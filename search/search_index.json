It is likely that if you're working on upping your DPM, you will need to improve in one or many of these areas. The first step is recognizing what mistakes you're making, then work on the solution. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, some of these mistakes are harder to fix than others. Remember, everything takes practice.

Why it\u2019s Important Depending on what ability you cancelled late, you will lose anywhere from 1 to 3 ticks every channeled ability you don\u2019t cancel properly. As an example, in a 5 minute gem you will use up to 12 Asphyx's , assuming you don't cancel them, it will add up to 21.6 seconds that you\u2019re standing idle for. That\u2019s enough time for 10 extra abilities. Canceling too early is also suboptimal as you lose out on the damage from the channeled ability.

It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks. Terminology Common Abbreviations in PvM \u2b25 DPM - damage per minute, a measure of how much damage is done over a minute time \u2b25 DPS \u2013 damage per second, or in-general referring to damage \u2b25 DW \u2013 dual wield, a wand/orb or wand/book weapon \u2b25 2H \u2013 Two hand, a staff weapon \u2b25 Juggling/Swapping \u2013 Generally referring to switching between dual wield and 2H weapons to gain access to more damaging abilities \u2b25 Camping \u2013 Refers to using only one type of weapon, ie. 2H camping or DW camping \u2b25 Rotation \u2013 Refers to the usage of abilities and managing ability cooldowns \u2b25 Switch \u2013 Refers to a weapon or gear item that is equipped and use temporarily for its effects \u2b25 Auto \u2013 an auto attack, damage based on which spell tier is used in your spellbook \u2b25 Tick \u2013 A unit of time in which a game action can occur. Runescape's tick is 0.6 seconds in duration \u2b25 Lossless - meaning no ticks are lost in performing an action \u2b25 GCD - global cooldown. An innate cooldown built into every ability. Lasts for 3 ticks (1.8 seconds) Note: For more abbreviations, see Evil Lucario's list of common PVM Lingo and Abbreviations: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZmDhx-SJsrVo0iTNwgMN3YsuJ9CrHcySd3hptvz3Ds/ Revolution Revo++ \u2b25 Revolution++ is a combat mode wherein you can toggle the game to automatically activate basic, threshold, and ultimate abilities automatically upon reaching the required adrenaline. \u2b25 While we do not encourage using Revo++ as it limits the amount of control a player has over their own rotation, it is low-input and low maintenance. \u2b25 Revo++ can be desirable for afking, low-effort pvm, or slayer tasks. \u2b25 Here is an ability bar we recommend for Revo++, using this bar with 0 player input will yield ~130k DPM: \u2b25 To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the cog icon on your ability bar: Basic Revolution \u2b25 Basic Revolution (commonly referred to as simply \"Revolution\") is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated. \u2b25 Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities. \u2b25 Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution: \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Note that the thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar \u2212 you will be manually activating them. \u2b25 If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Activate sunshine once you reach 100% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Wild Magic , Asphyxiate , Deep Impact ). Repeat. \u2b25 Following this simple repeating pattern of Build to 100% \u2192 Sunshine \u2192 Thresholds \u2192 Repeat , one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input. Full Manual Why to Use Full Manual \u2b25 Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player. \u2b25 The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario. \u2b25 Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode. How to Approach Using Full Manual \u2b25 While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Refer to the revolution bars as examples. \u2b25 Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice. \u2b25 Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution. \u2b25 An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough. \u2b25 Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta). There is no easy \"trick\" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it! Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation Ability Prioritization \u2b25 Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again \u2013 during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. \u2b25 To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND short cooldowns, in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. \u2b25 See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum): Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons. Building a Rotation \u2b25 When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. \u2b25 You want to make sure to prioritize usage of Wild Magic and Asphyxiate as these are your strongest thresholds, ideally you use them in your ultimate like Sunshine , and generally they should the first couple thresholds you use. Further, if cooldowns and adrenaline permit outside of these cases they are of high priority too. \u2b25 Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath , Corruption Blast , flank Impact , and walked Combust . \u2b25 Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave/Concentrated Blast / would be considered a weak ability (Wrack , Tuska's Wrath , Sacrifice , non-flank Impact , single-target Chain ). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally speaking, these should be avoided. \u2b25 If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast , respectively). Thus, try to utilize Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast as often as possible in your rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A basic pattern of Sonic Wave \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. \u2b25 For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast as filler abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Sonic Wave \u2192 Ability \u2192 Concentrated Blast \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat will give you strong dps. Ability Information General \u2b25 Note: t = \"ticks\", s = \"seconds\" \u2b25 All Magic AoE abilities (except Corruption Blast ) give an extra 2 + (Invigorating Rank * 0.2) adrenaline if they hit a secondary target. Autos \u2b25 All Autos are affected by Invigorating: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (Invigorating Rank * 10)% increased adrenaline on Autos \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e-

This section will be dedicated to Detonate due to how differently it works compared to normal channels. \u2b25 Unlike other channels, Detonate acts like or can have the following done within it: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It acts somehwat like a defensive in the context of defensive autos (you can release Detonate with an Auto given the Auto is not on cooldown) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can throw Vulnerability Bombs during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can SBS during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can Shield Dome during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can stall its release \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Generally speaking you cannot stall channels (outside of melees wherein only 1 hit is stalled) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is not affected by the Channeller's Ring due to not actually being a channeled ability \u2b25 Typically, when releasing Detonate you will release it with an Auto and an Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An example would be the following: Auto Sonic Wave \u2192 Detonate (3t/1.8s) \u2192 Auto Deto Dragon Breath ( \u2192 (3t/1.8s) \u2192 ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The order things are listed here are important, you want to do Auto then Detonate then Dragon Breath on the same tick in that order to release them with Detonate \u2b25 There is an odd occurence wherein Detonate will cost 30% adrenaline instead of 15% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can be explained as follows: the game thinks you both have a target and not at the same time, so it uses adrenaline from both your target and the adrenaline inherently used from using it without a target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- To prevent this, try casting any damaging ability before you hit Detonate \u2b25 Further, Detonate works like normal AoEs wherein it is centered at the true center of the target (for any >=2x2 target this will be the SW tile) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, if you cast Detonate without a target, it will be centered on your player \u2b25 Moreover, its worth keeping in mind the difference in AoE size dependent on the charge of deto on release, as represented in the following diagram: Dual Wield vs Staff Camp This section is meant to list the benefits of camping one over the other though it is strongly recommended to just juggle, as it gives access to all the following benefits, and more. Staff Camp Benefits \u2b25 Access to 2H Autos \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When staff camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath which you would otherwise have to use due to lack of abilities \u2b25 More Revolution-friendly \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to using Sonic Wave over Concentrated Blast , as Sonic Wave is not a channeled ability. Dual Wield Camp Benefits \u2b25 Easier swapping \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can swap to Shield or Flanks more easily, as you do not need to do an additional mainhand swap Defensive Autos Note: While this section is colloquialy referred to as \"Defensive Autos\", it is more technical to say it is non-damaging abilities, and so includes Sunshine and Metamorphosis . Why Defensive Autos Exist \u2b25 Typically, when you cast an ability it put your Auto on cooldown based on the weapon speed of the weapon it was cast with \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 i.e., if you cast an average speed (staff ability) it will be 6t (3.6s), if you cast a fastest speed (wand ability) it will be 4t (2.4s) \u2b25 Non-damaging abilities are the exception to this rule, so if you cast one it will not put your auto on cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This has several implications, the first applies to all styles, the second is magic specific Implications \u2b25 Firstly, this means if you cast a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your Auto will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage or Entagle ) then the defensive \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following table will break down the ticks of this: T0: Wand Ability T3: Defensive T4: Auto is cast T6: Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto , as the cooldown for any Auto ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the dw abil cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A further consideration, is if that ability on t6 is a non-channeled dw ability, you can 4tick an ability afterwards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This can be seen in the following video by #Glaucon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw \u2b25 Secondly, a benefit magic has, due to it having auto binds, is that you can make sure an auto + ability is cast on the same tick (rather than an auto is cast on 1 tick, and the ability a tick after) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows magic to do a 2H abil into a defensive auto as a result \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following table will break down the ticks of this: T0: Staff Ability T3: Defensive T6: Auto + Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Melee and Ranged this would result in: T0: Average Speed 2H Ability T3: Defensive T6: Auto T7: Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is important as it is highly beneficial to make use of this when staff camping, as it will aid in preventing you using bad abilities like Tuska's Wrath and Sacrifice due to the lack of abilities at your disposal \u2b25 It is important to note that Freedom works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2h auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you wanted to change what the 2H auto is, you would have to 3 tick it \u2b25 It is also important to note that if you click anything from your inventory, or click the ground anywhere, before the auto would naturally fire then you must re-click your target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With Magic, hitting your auto bind yields the same result Delaying Defensive Auto \u2b25 Based off this fact, you can make use of this if you need to delay a defensive auto for whatever reason \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what both the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following examples will be done with Freedom , however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Freedom specifically, we will \"off\" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto \u2b25 There are several ways to \"off\" to delay the auto, these include: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking under yourself \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking a spell you cannot cast (e.g., trying to cast Disruption Shield when on the Ancient Spellbook) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking something from your inventory Note: If you do any of these things before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto. \u2b25 There are also a couple differences between hitting your auto bind to cast your auto and clicking to cast your auto after you \"off\", they are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You cannot hit your auto bind to try and recast your auto mid-GCD, you need to 3 tick it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you use your auto bind to recast your auto, you can alter what the auto will be when you cast it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can click to recast your auto mid-GCD \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you click to recast your auto, your next ability must be at least 1 tick after otherwise you will override it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- if you click to recast your auto ideally you do it mid-GCD so that you do not waste ticks \u2b25 Thus, for Freedom we can do as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Instead of the normal T0: Dual Wield Ability T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast T4: 2H Auto cast T6: Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We can instead do: T0: Dual Wield Ability T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast T4: \"Off\" T6: 2H Auto + Ability Note: For both of these sample videos, Air Surge is the auto-casted spell and Fire Surge is the manually selected auto. I manually change the Defensive Auto to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration \u2b25 What are the differences between these two scenarios? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2H Auto is cast and thus hits at different times \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We can alter the 2H Auto in the second scenario, whereas in the first it will be whatever your autocasted spell is \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- We can alter the OH Auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto \u2192 Freedom (e.g., \u2192 ) Note: This is how we can alter the Auto sent with Non-Damaging Abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you \"off\" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H Auto with Freedom . Switches This section will detail several switches that are useful for magic, and should be incorporated as comfortable and when relevant. Juggling / \u2b25 This is simply referring to either adding a Dual Wield swap or Staff swap depending on if you currently Staff camp or Dual Wield Camp. \u2b25 This is highly beneficial to do as it gives you access to Conc Blast or Sonic Wave respectively. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, it gives you a new filler ability to make use of and so you can manage cooldowns more effective and also increase your average damage overall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Moreover, it gives you all the benefits that Staff camping and Dual Wield camping alone provides. \u2b25 This is a good stepping stone for those that wish to move away from weapon camping but are not confident enough, or simply to not desire, to 4-tick auto attack (4TAA). Guthix Staff \u2b25 This is a basic switch to incorporate into rotations, and is beneficial to do so where possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is generally speaking bosses where you require the affinity debuff or if you have excess adrenaline to dump. \u2b25 The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack. \u2b25 There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is benficial to Ring of Vigour this special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This brings the adrenline cost from 25% to 22.5%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you have Aftershock you will have to 0-tick your special attack in order to keep your Aftershock stacks. \u2b25 0-ticking in this context refers to swapping from a weapon with Aftershock to Guthix Staff , which does not have it, to a different weapon with Aftershock in the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This works because the game only checks if Aftershock is on at the end of a tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Starting on Weapon A, to do this simply do: \u2192 \u2192 Weapon B \u2b25 If you 4TAA, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, to 0-tick your spec starting on Weapon A you will have to: \u2192 \u2192 equip Weapon B \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you do not wish to 0-tick your spec, then you do not need to do the weapon swap at the end on the same tick. Planted Feet \u2b25 This is a very strong switch that requires minimal effort to incorporate. \u2b25 This perk increases the duration of Sunshine at the cost of its Damage over Time (DoT). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It makes Sunshine's duration go from 52t/31.2s total (t0\u219251) to 64t/38.4s total (t0\u2192t63). \u2b25 Generally speaking you always want to Sunshine with your Planted Feet switch. \u2b25 Typically this perk will go on a defender so that you do not need to bring both a shield and planted feet when a shield is required for Resonance or building adrenaline only \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This perk can also be seen put on Wands \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, in rare instances, this perk can also be seen put on an Enhanced Excalibur for content that requires both a shield and planted feet switch where saving any inventory space is important. Flanking \u2b25 This is a simple, yet strongly recommend switch to incorporate, especially for those doing group-based content. \u2b25 This turns Impact and Deep Impact into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun which is largely irrelevant \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases Minimum of Impact by (Flanking Rank * 8)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 40)% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases Minimum of Deep Impact by (Flanking Rank * 6)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 30)% \u2b25 It is recommended to put this perk on an off-hand switch \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Reduces the damage and accuracy loss of using a lower tier weapon for switch (Praesul Wand + Virtus Book > + Imperium Core ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to the fact that if you swap main-hands you lose the crit buff of Concentrated Blast Dragonrider Amulet \u2b25 This is a more advanced switch thats usefulness goes down as the necklace you primarily wear gets better. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Unless Reaper Necklace accuracy is needed, in the current state of the game even with an Essence of Finality (or) equipped it is still a DPS increase to incorporate this as a switch. \u2b25 This necklace increases the power of Dragon Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It boosts its damage by 10% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It has a 10% chance of applying a bleeding effect that hits 3 times and deals 10% of Dragon Breath's max hit rounded down per hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This excludes boosts that do not normally boost bleeds Seren Godbow \u2b25 This is an advanced switch to incorporate into rotations, though it is highly beneficial to do so where it is worth it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 this is generally speaking bosses that are 5x5 in size or larger. \u2b25 The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack. \u2b25 There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You must own the Ingenuity of the Humans ability (Ingen) to ensure the special attack does not splash. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you do not, depending on the content done, you may have to remove several pieces of armor to reduce the odds of splashing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is beneficial to Ring of Vigour this special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This brings the adrenaline cost from 30% to 27%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly beneficial to pray flick to either Anguish or Desolation . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This not only increases accuracy if you need to cast the special attack without Ingen , but also considerably increases the damage in any scenario. \u2b25 If you 4taa, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is worth noting as it is a heavy input sequence to execute in a single tick: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The order in which you do things does not necessarily matter so long as the Auto is first and the Special is last. 4TAA What it is \u2b25 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA), is an extension of weapon juggling wherein, as the name implies, you force an auto attack on the 4th tick after casting the ability before \u2b25 As mentioned earlier, when you cast a damaging ability it will put your autos on cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 4t cooldown after a fastest speed (wand) ability, 6t after an average speed (staff) ability \u2b25 So to 4TAA, we make use of this fact, along with the fact that Magic can force an auto + ability on the same tick due to having access to spell (and thus auto) binds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We make use of this by delaying our next ability by a tick to force an auto and ability on the 4th tick How it Works \u2b25 The general 4TAA structure will be like: Auto + 2H/Dw Ability \u2192 non-channeled Dw Ability \u2192 Repeat \u2b25 As you can see, the auto is forced every other ability, this is simply due to the fact that 2H autos have a 6t cooldown so you can only cast it after every other ability \u2b25 Further, you can see the ability before it repeats (i.e., before you do your next auto + ability) has to be a non-channeled Dw ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It must be a dw ability due to the 4t auto cooldown associated with it, allowing you to do a 2H auto 4t later \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It must be non-channeled because each hit of a channel resets your auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Thus it is generally ideal to always do an auto into your channeled ability \u2b25 Moreover, you can see that after an auto you can do either a 2H or Dw ability, this is because it does not particularly matter assuming same perking and tiers \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 That being said, you must (outside of very niche cases) always ensure that when you do an auto into a channeled, that the channeled ability is done with Dw (this is mostly important for Asphyxiate, as Concentrated Blast is already Dw locked, and Smoke Tendrils is not relevant) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is because of the fact that when the channeled hits reset your auto cd, it is going to reset it based off the weapon you are wearing, thus if you staff asphyx, when your asphyx ends your auto is on a 6t cooldown again \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The table below will showcase two different scenarios: 2H Asphyxiate: You MUST do: auto +

Wrack is generally not a good basic ability to use in combat and is only utilized here due to it's very short cooldown. In real combat, replace Wrack with Dragon Breath , Corruption Blast , Impact , Wild Magic , etc. \u2b25 When practising, set the combat dummy to 'Max Hit Mode' then take note of how much damage your Staff auto attack deals compared to a Wand auto attack. To benefit from 4TAA, you want to consistently do Staff auto attacks. \u2b25 Step 4 must be done in quick succession; all inputs must be done within one tick. To make this easier on yourself try keybinding your Wand/Orb/Auto in an easy to reach set of keystrokes. \u2b25 This guide only covers the basic pattern of 4TAA. Once you're confident in performing steps 1-6, try to mix and match other basic abilities to create your own 4TAA rotation. \u2b25 You will know you did not lose any ticks between auto and abilities if you do not see the auto firing animation, but the auto itself still firing 4TAA Troubleshooting While practising you may be unsure if you are messing up or not, so the following clips will showcase various scenarios: too fast, correctly, and too slow Note: the Auto damage in all the following clips is 2515 Too Fast This means you simply did not wait the additional tick required for the auto, and so casted your ability at GCD end instead of 1 tick after GCD end to get an Auto + Ability Correctly This means you did it correctly, this will demonstrate how it looks like in both Normals and Ancients Spellbooks \u2b25 If you did not mess up on Normals, you will not get the Auto casting animation and you will see the auto still be fired out. \u2b25 If you did not mess up on Ancients, you will not get the Auto casting animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you can also see, the Auto and Ability are cast as the GCD bar flashes Too Slow This means you were too late to cast your auto + ability, typically this results in a 5TAA (auto cast on tick 4, ability cast on tick 5), or worse (ability cast far later). More specifically, it means your ability will be delayed as your auto will automatically fire on the 4th tick either way, assuming you did not off General Sun Rotations This section will just detail a rough idea of thresholds to use under certain assumptions: 4TAA and Blast Diffusion Boots used.

High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again \u2013 during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. \u2b25 To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND short cooldowns, in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. \u2b25 See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum): Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons. Building a Rotation \u2b25 When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. \u2b25 You want to make sure to prioritize usage of Wild Magic and Asphyxiate as these are your strongest thresholds, ideally you use them in your ultimate like Sunshine , and generally they should the first couple thresholds you use. Further, if cooldowns and adrenaline permit outside of these cases they are of high priority too. \u2b25 Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath , Corruption Blast , flank Impact , and walked Combust . \u2b25 Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave/Concentrated Blast / would be considered a weak ability (Wrack , Tuska's Wrath , Sacrifice , non-flank Impact , single-target Chain ). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally speaking, these should be avoided. \u2b25 If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast , respectively).

you cast an average speed (staff ability) it will be 6t (3.6s), if you cast a fastest speed (wand ability) it will be 4t (2.4s) \u2b25 Non-damaging abilities are the exception to this rule, so if you

Firstly, this means if you cast a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your Auto will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Normally this will be whatever you have

following table will break down the ticks of this: T0: Wand Ability T3: Defensive T4: Auto is cast T6: Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto , as the cooldown for any Auto ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the dw abil cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A further consideration, is if that ability on t6 is a non-channeled dw ability, you can 4tick an ability afterwards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This can be seen in the following video by #Glaucon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw \u2b25 Secondly, a benefit magic has, due to it having auto binds, is that you can make sure an auto + ability is cast on the same tick (rather than an auto is cast on 1 tick, and the ability a tick after) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows magic to do a 2H abil into a defensive auto as a result \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following table will break down the ticks of this: T0: Staff Ability T3: Defensive T6: Auto + Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Melee and Ranged this would result in: T0: Average Speed 2H Ability T3: Defensive T6: Auto T7: Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is important as it is highly beneficial to make use of this when staff camping, as it will aid in preventing you using bad abilities like Tuska's Wrath and Sacrifice due to the lack of abilities at your disposal \u2b25 It is important to note that Freedom works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2h auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you wanted to change what the 2H auto is, you would have to 3 tick it \u2b25 It is also important to note that if you click anything from your inventory, or click the ground anywhere, before the auto would naturally fire then you must re-click your target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With Magic, hitting your auto bind yields the same result Delaying Defensive Auto \u2b25 Based off this fact, you can make use of this if you need to delay a defensive auto for whatever reason \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what both the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following examples will be done with Freedom , however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Freedom specifically, we will \"off\" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto \u2b25 There are several ways to \"off\" to delay the auto, these include: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking under yourself \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking a spell you cannot cast (e.g., trying to cast Disruption Shield when on the Ancient Spellbook) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking something from your inventory Note: If you do any of these things before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto. \u2b25 There are also a couple differences between hitting your auto bind to cast your auto and clicking to cast your auto after you \"off\", they are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You cannot hit your auto bind to try and recast your auto mid-GCD, you need to 3 tick it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you use your auto bind to recast your auto, you can alter what the auto will be when you cast it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can click to recast your auto mid-GCD \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you click to recast your auto, your next ability must be at least 1 tick after otherwise you will override it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- if you click to recast your auto ideally you do it mid-GCD so that you do not waste ticks \u2b25 Thus, for Freedom we can do as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Instead of the normal T0: Dual Wield Ability T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast T4: 2H Auto cast T6: Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We can instead do: T0: Dual Wield Ability T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast T4: \"Off\" T6: 2H Auto + Ability Note: For both of these sample videos, Air Surge is the auto-casted spell and Fire Surge is the manually selected auto. I manually change the Defensive Auto to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration \u2b25 What are the differences between these two scenarios? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2H Auto is cast and thus hits at different times \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We can alter the 2H Auto in the second scenario, whereas in the first it will be whatever your autocasted spell is \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- We can alter the OH Auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto \u2192 Freedom (e.g., \u2192 ) Note: This is how we can alter the Auto sent with Non-Damaging Abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you \"off\" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H Auto with Freedom .","title":"Defensive Autos"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-mage/#switches","text":"This section will detail several switches that are useful for magic, and should be incorporated as comfortable and when relevant. Juggling / \u2b25 This is simply referring to either adding a Dual Wield swap or Staff swap depending on if you currently Staff camp or Dual Wield Camp. \u2b25 This is highly beneficial to do as it gives you access to Conc Blast or Sonic Wave respectively. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, it gives you a new filler ability to make use of and so you can manage cooldowns more effective and also increase your average damage overall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Moreover, it gives you all the benefits that Staff camping and Dual Wield camping alone provides. \u2b25 This is a good stepping stone for those that wish to move away from weapon camping but are not confident enough, or simply to not desire, to 4-tick auto attack (4TAA). Guthix Staff \u2b25 This is a basic switch to incorporate into rotations, and is beneficial to do so where possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is generally speaking bosses where you require the affinity debuff or if you have excess adrenaline to dump. \u2b25 The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack. \u2b25 There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is benficial to Ring of Vigour this special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This brings the adrenline cost from 25% to 22.5%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you have Aftershock you will have to 0-tick your special attack in order to keep your Aftershock stacks. \u2b25 0-ticking in this context refers to swapping from a weapon with Aftershock to Guthix Staff , which does not have it, to a different weapon with Aftershock in the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This works because the game only checks if Aftershock is on at the end of a tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Starting on Weapon A, to do this simply do: \u2192 \u2192 Weapon B \u2b25 If you 4TAA, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, to 0-tick your spec starting on Weapon A you will have to: \u2192 \u2192 equip Weapon B \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you do not wish to 0-tick your spec, then you do not need to do the weapon swap at the end on the same tick. Planted Feet \u2b25 This is a very strong switch that requires minimal effort to incorporate. \u2b25 This perk increases the duration of Sunshine at the cost of its Damage over Time (DoT). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It makes Sunshine's duration go from 52t/31.2s total (t0\u219251) to 64t/38.4s total (t0\u2192t63). \u2b25 Generally speaking you always want to Sunshine with your Planted Feet switch. \u2b25 Typically this perk will go on a defender so that you do not need to bring both a shield and planted feet when a shield is required for Resonance or building adrenaline only \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This perk can also be seen put on Wands \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, in rare instances, this perk can also be seen put on an Enhanced Excalibur for content that requires both a shield and planted feet switch where saving any inventory space is important. Flanking \u2b25 This is a simple, yet strongly recommend switch to incorporate, especially for those doing group-based content. \u2b25 This turns Impact and Deep Impact into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun which is largely irrelevant \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases Minimum of Impact by (Flanking Rank * 8)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 40)% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases Minimum of Deep Impact by (Flanking Rank * 6)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 30)% \u2b25 It is recommended to put this perk on an off-hand switch \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Reduces the damage and accuracy loss of using a lower tier weapon for switch (Praesul Wand + Virtus Book > + Imperium Core ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to the fact that if you swap main-hands you lose the crit buff of Concentrated Blast Dragonrider Amulet \u2b25 This is a more advanced switch thats usefulness goes down as the necklace you primarily wear gets better. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Unless Reaper Necklace accuracy is needed, in the current state of the game even with an Essence of Finality (or) equipped it is still a DPS increase to incorporate this as a switch. \u2b25 This necklace increases the power of Dragon Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It boosts its damage by 10% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It has a 10% chance of applying a bleeding effect that hits 3 times and deals 10% of Dragon Breath's max hit rounded down per hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This excludes boosts that do not normally boost bleeds Seren Godbow \u2b25 This is an advanced switch to incorporate into rotations, though it is highly beneficial to do so where it is worth it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 this is generally speaking bosses that are 5x5 in size or larger. \u2b25 The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack. \u2b25 There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You must own the Ingenuity of the Humans ability (Ingen) to ensure the special attack does not splash. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you do not, depending on the content done, you may have to remove several pieces of armor to reduce the odds of splashing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is beneficial to Ring of Vigour this special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This brings the adrenaline cost from 30% to 27%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly beneficial to pray flick to either Anguish or Desolation . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This not only increases accuracy if you need to cast the special attack without Ingen , but also considerably increases the damage in any scenario. \u2b25 If you 4taa, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is worth noting as it is a heavy input sequence to execute in a single tick: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The order in which you do things does not necessarily matter so long as the Auto is first and the Special is last.","title":"Switches"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-mage/#4taa","text":"What it is \u2b25 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA), is an extension of weapon juggling wherein, as the name implies, you force an auto attack on the 4th tick after casting the ability before \u2b25 As mentioned earlier, when you cast a damaging ability it will put your autos on cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 4t cooldown after a fastest speed (wand) ability, 6t after an average speed (staff) ability \u2b25 So to 4TAA, we make use of this fact, along with the fact that Magic can force an auto + ability on the same tick due to having access to spell (and thus auto) binds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We make use of this by delaying our next ability by a tick to force an auto and ability on the 4th tick How it Works \u2b25 The general 4TAA structure will be like: Auto + 2H/Dw Ability \u2192 non-channeled Dw Ability \u2192 Repeat \u2b25 As you can see, the auto is forced every other ability, this is simply due to the fact that 2H autos have a 6t cooldown so you can only cast it after every other ability \u2b25 Further, you can see the ability before it repeats (i.e., before you do your next auto + ability) has to be a non-channeled Dw ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It must be a dw ability due to the 4t auto cooldown associated with it, allowing you to do a 2H auto 4t later \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It must be non-channeled because each hit of a channel resets your auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Thus it is generally ideal to always do an auto into your channeled ability \u2b25 Moreover, you can see that after an auto you can do either a 2H or Dw ability, this is because it does not particularly matter assuming same perking and tiers \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 That being said, you must (outside of very niche cases) always ensure that when you do an auto into a channeled, that the channeled ability is done with Dw (this is mostly important for Asphyxiate, as Concentrated Blast is already Dw locked, and Smoke Tendrils is not relevant) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is because of the fact that when the channeled hits reset your auto cd, it is going to reset it based off the weapon you are wearing, thus if you staff asphyx, when your asphyx ends your auto is on a 6t cooldown again \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The table below will showcase two different scenarios: 2H Asphyxiate: You MUST do: auto + asphyxiate \u2192 ability \u2192 dw abil \u2192 auto + ability Dw Asphyxiate: You can do: auto + asphyxiate \u2192 dw

Using this recommended ability bar with zero player input you can achieve a DPM of roughly 130k. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DW revo++ bar \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 2h revo++ bar \u2b25 To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the cog icon on your ability bar: Basic Revolution \u2b25 Revolution (not revo++) is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated. \u2b25 Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities. \u2b25 Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DW revolution bar \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 2h revolution bar Note: The thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar \u2212 you will be manually activating them. \u2b25 If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Activate Berserk once you reach 100% adrenaline. From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Assault , Destroy , Hurricane , Quake ). Repeat. \u2b25 Following this simple repeating pattern of Build to 100% -> Berserk - > Thresholds -> Repeat , one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input. Full Manual Why to Use Full Manual \u2b25 Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player. \u2b25 The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario. \u2b25 Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode. How to Approach Using Full Manual \u2b25 While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Refer to the revolution bars as examples. \u2b25 Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice. \u2b25 Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution. \u2b25 An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough. \u2b25 Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/Kr'il/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta). Note: There is no easy \"trick\" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it! Overview - Melee DPS Why to Return to Your Cave Man Roots \u2b25 Compared to the other two combat styles, Melee is unique in that it is the only combat style that restricts you to a maximum range of 1-2 distance away from your target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As such, it is inherently more difficult to deal with certain boss mechanics at such a close range. \u2b25 The benefit is that Melee has the capability of dealing both great burst and sustained damage as central parts of its kits. \u2b25 Melee can reach a ceiling of 220k DPM whereas Mage and Range cap out at around 200k DPM. \u2b25 Melee is also unique in that to achieve such a high DPM benchmark a variety of weapon switches are needed - more so than the other styles. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since obtaining weapon switches is not a linear path (ie. players likely choose weapon switches based on cost), the progression path of melee makes less sense in DPM thresholds and more sense in terms of gradual incorporation of weapon switches. Camping a Weapon What to Pack for Your Camping Trip \u2b25 Camping in this context refers to the exclusive usage of either DW or 2H without taking advantage of the benefits from switching. \u2b25 Most players will start learning melee by grabbing a 2h or DW and camping with said weapon. \u2b25 While you are limited to what rotations you can do while camping 2h or DW, it is still important to optimize with what you have. \u2b25 Your rotation will be generally built around either Lesser Fury or Greater Fury , depending on availability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 High damage basics such as Cleave (2h exclusive), Decimate (DW exclusive), and Sever should be used as often as possible following Fury. \u2b25 Rotations will follow a simple scheme: Fury \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat. \u2b25 The general idea is to build to your Berserk , and then within Berserk, use Assault , then either Destroy (DW) or Hurricane (2h), and then if you have the adrenaline to spare, use either Flurry (DW) or Quake (2h). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Two-Handed Build to 100% \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Quake \u2192 Repeat \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dual Wield Build to 100% \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Destroy \u2192 Flurry \u2192 Repeat Note: For 1v1 situations, DW is more damage. In 1vMany situations, 2h deals more damage. Intermediate and Advanced Tactics DW and 2H Weapon Switching \u2b25 The biggest jump in DPM will come from incorporating weapon juggling of DW and 2h weapons. \u2b25 Having both weapon styles gives access to both DW Decimate and 2h Cleave basic abilities, each sporting a strong 188% ability damage and a low 7s cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Even if you have to pair a high tier weapon with a lower tier weapon, the ability to access both Deci/Cleave is worth it (eg. Drygores with Dragon Rider Lance). \u2b25 With DW/2h Switching, it is possible to break beyond the 170k DPM barrier that Camping generally struggles to overcome. \u2b25 Example pairings of DW and 2h weapons: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t70 Abyssal Whip + Enhanced Excalibur \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t80 Avaryss and Nymora Blades \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t90 Elder Rune \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t90 Drygores \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t92 Khopeshes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t70 Any GWD1 Godsword \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t80 Dragon Rider Lance \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t90 Noxious Scythe \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t92 Zaros Godsword \u2b25 Here we will abandon camping rotations built around Fury Fury \u2192 Basic \u2192 Basic \u2192 Repeat. \u2b25 Your new DW/2h rotations will be built around Decimate and Cleave Deci \u2192 Cleave \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat. OR Cleave \u2192 Deci \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat. \u2b25 Substitute 'Ability' with other strong basic abilities such as Dismember , Sever , Fury , Backhand-Flanking , etc. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We use Deci/Cleave as often as possible as they each have a 7s cooldown and deal great damage at 188% ability damage. Berserk Rotations with DW/2h Switching Note: These are different than the weapon camping rotations \u2b25 With Adrenaline Pot Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Destroy \u2192 Forceful Backhand OR Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Destroy \u2192 Greater Flurry \u2b25 Without Adrenaline Pot Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Forceful Backhand OR Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Greater Flurry Note: Use Greater Flurry over Forceful Backhand-Flanking if you have it available 2h vs DW Assault \u2b25 Assault hit splats will land at different times depending on whether it is cast with 2h or DW. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The timing to cancel it remains unchanged. 2 4 6 8 for 2h 3 5 7 9 for dw Greater Barge The Basics \u2b25 Greater Barge can be unlocked by consuming a Greater Barge Ability Codex, which then transforms your normal Barge ability into \u2b25 Greater Barge works as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It will break you free of binds, and where applicable bind a target for 11 ticks (6.6sec) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 By default has a damage range of 25%-125% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, for each tick (0.6sec) since the player stopped attacking their target, Greater Barge gains +10% to its max damage range, and +2% to its min, capping at 10 tick (6s) for +100% and +20%, for a final range of 45%-225% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If it has been atleast 8 ticks (4.8sec) since you stopped attacking it gains another effect, indicated by the Greater Barge icon appearing on your Buff Bar, then it gains an additional effect: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Any melee channeled ability used within 10 ticks (6sec) of casting Greater Barge, indicated by the a Provoke-like icon appearing on your Buff Bar, will be turned into a damage-over-time (DoT) instead \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For the sake of simplicity converting a channeled ability into a DoT is referred to as \"bleeding\" it, or having \"bled\" it, or you are going to \"bleed\" that threshold; however, these should not be confused with normal bleeds (e.g. ), as they are different. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, this is the actual reason Greater Barge is so strong \u2b25 Greater Barge is commonly used as follows, in the following cases: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 First is simply at the start of a fight, as you should not have attacked anything long enough and thus can freely Greater Barge and then convert a channeled ability into a DoT \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Secondly is after any mechanic that forces you to off, such as Vorago's Reflect mechanic, as you again should not have attacked anything long enough allowing you to then Greater Barge freely \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The third case is stalling your rotation mid-combat before you to get the effect within it, which is done as follows: Exploring How to Execute the Third Case Properly \u2b25 Damaging Ability (e.g. ) \u2192 click off atleast 1 tick (0.6sec) before your Defensive \u2192 Defensive (e.g. ) \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Greater Barge \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is important to click off atleast 1 tick prior otherwise you will not get the effect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is thought to be because the game thinks you have tried to cast an auto as a result of the Defensive, and so resets the Greater Barge effect timer \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Also, as seen here, there are 9 ticks (5.4sec) between the the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge, which is 1 more tick (0.6sec) than required \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- So, if said Ability gets you the adrenaline to Berserk , then it is a tick (0.6s) more efficient to do as follows: \u2b25 Damaging Ability (e.g. ) \u2192 wait 2 ticks (1.2sec) \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Greater Barge \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As seen here, there are now 8 ticks (4.8sec) between the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge \u2b25 Here is a demonstration: https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw The Cost of Using Greater Barge \u2b25 In general the cost of utilizing Greater Barge is an Auto in say your Berserk , but in the third case the cost is a Damaging Ability (e.g. ) + your Auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Though the benefit is an extra 4 ticks in say your Berserk which is large enough to be worth said cost Notes on Greater Barge Note: bullets marked with \u2605 are likely bugs, or at the very least unintended \u2b25 Multiple people can stack their Greater Barge bled abilities, unlike what would be possible with normal bleed abilities \u2b25 If you bleed Greater Flurry all the hits will reduce your Berserk cooldown, as you allow its full duration to channel now \u2b25 If you bleed Greater Flurry you need to be careful for a couple reasons: \u2605 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are out of melee distance, it does the equivalent of its AoE (i.e., normal Flurry's) damage, which is far weaker than Greater Flurry's damage per hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Similarly, this occurs if you are adjacent to other targets \u2b25 If you using queuing, if you have no target, ensure to not queue your Greater Barge before TCing and using it, otherwise you will not get the buff to bleed a channeled ability \u2605 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Similar issues occur when clicking over TCing, though likely not a bug, but important to be aware of nonetheless \u2b25 Greater Barge also does not give adrenaline if you still have a target that is dead \u2605 \u2b25 If for whatever reason you were to bleed Frenzy , it only does 180% hits \u2605 \u2b25 Equipping a different tier of weapon after bleeding will change the damage of the weapon according to the latter weapon tier \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This occurs as it is still attempting to cast each hit separately, like a normal channel \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also means each hit has its own chance to hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For example, of you bleed with a t90 weapon equipped, then switch to t92 the damage will be calculated as t92 damage for any remaining hits \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This has some odd interactions with weapons such as Terassaur Maul which will be explored momentarily \u2605 \u2b25 Vorago will not clear these DoTs on reflect \u2b25 The hit timings of Greater Barge bleeds follow a fixed pattern: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first hit's hit timing corresponds with the time it would normally hit as a channeled ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, 2H Assault hit 1 would be 2t (1.2sec) delayed, whereas DW Assault hit 1 would be 3t (1.8sec) delayed \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hits 2-4 will always hit 5t, 7t, and 9t (3sec, 4.2sec, 5.4sec) delayed respectively \u2b25 Further if you stall a barge bleed the following will occur: \u2605 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hits 2-4 will hit as normal on the target you casted the ability on to stall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hit 1 will be the only hit that gets stalled, and when released will hit the same time as it would normally hit if it were the first hit of its channeled ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Furthermore, what this means is you can far-cast your barge bleed on a target to make hits 2-4 hit it from a large distance technically Greater Barge Interation with Weapon Effects \u2b25 For sake of example, Assault and Terassaur Maul will be used; however, this affects any barge bleed and, as far as is known, is caused by the following weapons as well: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bane Weaponry \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Keris \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Darklight \u2b25 Essentially what happens is that after you apply a bleed with one of these weapons, such as a Terassaur Maul , and then you swap weapons, for instance to a T92 weapon (e.g. ), the effect is applied ontop of the t92 weapon's damage for the remaining hits \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As in, with the Terassaur Maul example, if you bleed Assault against a Ranged monster, and then swap to a t92 weapon, for each bleed hit casted with t92 on it will result in t92 + 12.5% damage, rather than T80 + 12.5% damage, which is quite a large increase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, if you bleed with t92, and then swap to the maul , it will just do its normal damage without the modifier being applied Deviating Upgrade Paths Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood Note: As with any upgrade path, feel free to ask any questions you have in #unknown-channel \u2b25 The prioritization of upgrades can vary depending on what your focus is with PvM. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is largely due to the fact the costs of each upgrade is relatively high \u2b25 Generally speaking it is recommended to pick up a Greater Barge codex first . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Its special affect allows you to turn channeled abilities into bleeds. \u2b25 Further, it is worth aiming to get Greater Flurry as well \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Largely because it can be nice for utilizing all your Berserk-boosted ticks during you Berserk \u2b25 That being said, Greater Fury is pretty minor and should be delayed until much later \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Though it may be nice if you are planning to do a lot of afk-based revolution-using content \u2b25 Afterwards, if you will benefit from the special attack, it is generally recommended to get a Zaros Godsword \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Its extremely powerful special attack greatly improves your sustained DPM. \u2b25 Alternatively, you could pick up a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation if you can bleed at the encounter you are doing \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases the duration of bleeds, which is a relatively decent DPS increase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further it can be a good weapon to bridge the gap between t90 weaponry and Zaros Godsword, given it is far cheaper \u2b25 At high defense bosses such as Vorago, Angel of Death, and Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, it is recommended to pick up a Statius' Warhammer . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It has a special attack which significantly lowers defences for 1 minute. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It also increases your affinity against said target \u2b25 In the end you should aim to grab all three of these upgrades. Zaros Godsword \u2b25 The Zaros Godsword is a T92 2H melee weapon noteworthy for its powerful Special Attack 'Blackhole'. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blackhole is a DPS buff - essentially a Sunshine or Death's Swiftness for Melee - which uses 50% Adrenaline (45% with Vigour ), buffs damage by 25% and lasts for 35 ticks (t0-t34, 21 sec). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It should be used in rotation with Berserk (ie. use Blackhole when Berserk is on cooldown) OR when the situation is too dangerous to Berserk in. Note: You do not need to keep ZGS equipped once you've activated its special attack. Also note that ZGS does not have scythe range. \u2b25 ZGS rotations are similar to Berserk rotations but vary based on the boss. \u2b25 As for adrenaline potions, it is recommended to save adrenaline potions for Berserk as it is more valuable in Berserk with its higher damage modifier. Berserk + Adrenaline Potion / Limitless Sigil \u2192 Berserk Cooldown \u2192 ZGS Special \u2192 ZGS Cooldown \u2192 Repeat Masterwork Spear of Annihilation \u2b25 A fairly powerful weapon in its own right if you are able to bleed. \u2b25 Its effect is that it adds two additional hits to the following abilities: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dismember (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits, and up to 10 with the Strength Cape effect) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, because of this, the spear becomes your Lunging switch eventually \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Slaughter (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blood Tendrils (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits) Statius' Warhammer \u2b25 One of the more powerful aspects of melee in group pvm is access to the SWH special attack without the need for an Ingenuity of the Humans ability . \u2b25 If you intend to do group PvM it is recommended to buy a SWH and use its special attack at high defence bosses (eg. Vorago, Yakamaru, Beast Master, Angel of Death). \u2b25 Usage of the SWH varies from boss to boss and will be covered more specifically in our boss guides. Greater Fury \u2b25 Greater Fury can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Fury Ability Codex. \u2b25 This does a few things things: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Firstly, Fury is no longer a 3-hit channeled ability and instead only hits once dealing 157% ability damage (the same as the first two hits of the channeled version) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Secondly, the passive 5% critical hit chance increase per channelled hit changes to a single 10% critical hit chance increase on the next hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thirdly, it gains an extra effect where getting a critical hit on Greater Fury gives you a buff which guarantees the first hit of your next ability will crit \u2b25 The main benefit to this upgrade is transforming this ability from a 3-hit (5t/3.0s) channeled ability to a 1-hit non-channeled ability, and so it only requires a GCD to fully use. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows Greater Fury to be used in Revolution++ and Revolution setups without needing to manually cancel the channel after 2 hits. \u2b25 Due to the guaranteed crit effect, it is possible for to be stronger (on average) than a 188% ability ( / / ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is only possible when the crit chance of and the ability damage of the following ability are sufficiently high. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Currently, the only cases where these requirements are met are when you are under the effects of an active Grimoire (and have Biting perk ), and the ability following is either a flanked ability or a charged Greater Barge . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Another niche consideration is when under the effects of Berserk (and ), there is almost no damage difference between \u2192 and 188% \u2192 . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Without the active effects of , is basically always weaker than a 188% ability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Despite this, if you are put into a position where you have no 188% abilities available and need to use , you should consider following it up with a >188% ability to still maximise your damage. *Note: A sheet comparing to / / before various abilities can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1beHYkyPKV-tj8eHlbRDQTRX9GkdFBKhBr89B8fKyuXI/edit#gid=1063393167 * Greater Flurry \u2b25 Greater Flurry can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Flurry Ability Codex. \u2b25 The effect is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Perform a flurry of blows against your surrounding targets, dealing up to 94% weapon damage per hit over 3.6 seconds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If only one target is nearby, up to 157% weapon damage per hit will be dealt instead \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Additionally if an attack hits any target per swing, the cooldown of Berserk will be reduced by 1.2 seconds each swing \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is these last two bullets which make it worthwhile \u2b25 Once you've unlocked this threshold, it becomes your 3rd best threshold in Berserk. \u2b25 In addition, its unique effect of reducing Berserk cooldown is very useful in overall Melee rotations. \u2b25 There are several ways of using GFlurry. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can either cancel it on GCD (ie. 2 hits) for burst damage, or use it for its entire duration for its Berserk reduction effect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further you can 5t it (3 hit/3 sec), primarily used to align your ticks in Berserk after using a full channel like Destroy to still use all ticks of your ultimate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you bleed this threshold using gBarge, all bleed hits will contribute towards reducing Berserk's cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is used extensively at places like AoD and Solak where players want to Berserk as often as possible through out the fight. Remaining Upgrades \u2b25 At this stage, all important upgrades have been obtained and all that remains is to get inherent DPM boosting upgrades. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Following this, a T99 Codex for Malevolence , then something like Trimmed Masterwork (which is very useful due to its set effect, which delays damage) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Then it is encouraged to start picking up things such as Khopeshes . Weapon Switch Invention Perks Flanking 4 \u2b25 Flanking is a perk unlocked via Invention at level 55. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The effect is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Backhand, Impact and Binding Shot no longer stun and have their max increased by 40% and min increased by 8% per rank to targets that are not facing you. Forceful Backhand, Deep Impact and Tight Bindings no longer stun and have their max increased by 30% and min by 6% per rank to targets that are not facing you \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This goes up to rank 4. \u2b25 Should the opportunity arise at group bosses flanking can be incredibly powerful. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Backhand becomes your 2nd most powerful basic inside of Berserk while Forceful Backhand becomes your 4th best threshold in Berserk. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The basic ability Backhand should be used as often as possible and the threshold Forceful Backhand should be used either in Berserk or in-between Berserk cooldowns. Example Rotations with Flanking \u2b25 2h Camping Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Forceful Backhand-Flanking \u2192 Repeat \u2b25 DW Camping Berserk \u2192 Assault \u2192 Destroy \u2192 Forceful Backhand-Flanking \u2192 Repeat Note: For DW, once you have Greater Flurry unlocked it should be used as your 3rd threshold inside Berserk. Flanking would be downgraded to a threshold used in-between Berserk cooldowns. \u2b25 This perk should be placed on a Dual Wield Off-hand switch and upgraded to your highest tier available (Drygore t90 or dyed-Khopesh t92). \u2b25 Example bosses to bring flanking to include: Vorago , Angel of Death , group ED1-3 , Solak , and any other group bossing. Lunging 4 \u2b25 Lunging is a perk unlocked via Invention at level 89. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The effect is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The maximum damage of Combust, Dismember and Fragmentation shot is incrased by 20% weapon damage per rank, but enemies that move will only take 1.5x increased damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This goes up to rank 4. \u2b25 The only basic bleed in melee affected by Lunging is Dismember . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since Dismember cannot be walked to gain bonus damage, the effects of Lunging will always activate for Dismember, thus it is strictly an upgrade over non-lunging Dismember. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In fact, the effect of Lunging is extra strong on Dismember because Dismember cannot be walked (the same applies to the 99 Strength Cape effect). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- With Lunging 4 and Strength Cape effect combined, Dismember becomes the strongest basic ability for melee outside of Berserk. \u2b25 Dismember should be used outside Berserk as bleeds do not get boosted damage (Dismember has a 15s cooldown so you should plan to use Dismember before a Berserk, then 20s later, use Dismember after a Berserk). \u2b25 The goal is to have near 100% uptime of the Dismember effect when using Lunging4 + Strength Cape. \u2b25 A Dual Wield Off-hand switch should be used for this perk and later upgraded to a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation due to it further extending the duration of Dismember. Auto Attacks What They are and When to Use Them \u2b25 Once you've incorporated DW/2h Switching, auto attacks become more prevelant as a dps tool. \u2b25 When you can auto attack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: Fastest (e.g. drygore mainhand ) = 4t, Average (e.g. ) = 6t. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each time you do a Damaging Ability, it resets this cooldown. \u2b25 We will be using 2H auto attacks as they deal more damage. \u2b25 There are two specific instances of when you want to incorporate auto attacks into your rotation; one is 'passive', the other will is 5taa. 'Passive' Auto Attacks \u2b25 By performing a non-damaging ability, the auto attack cooldown is not reset, yet a GCD is 3t. \u2b25 So, during the GCD, assuming the ability before was non-channeled and cast with either Fast or Fastest speed weapons you will get an auto attack during your GCD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is because the respective cooldowns are 5t (3 sec) and 4t (2.4 sec), yet the GCD of the ability prior to the non-damaging ability will cover the first 3t of the cooldown, so the cooldown will end during the GCD caused by the non-damaging ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, you will have to click the boss if you somehow \"offed\" (e.g., by clicking under you) from it to get the auto \u2b25 Auto attacks can deal up to 5k damage, 8k in a Berserk and in most cases is worth the 2t wait. \u2b25 You can perform an auto attack on every Berserk activation by doing the following: Fast/Fastest weapon speed non-channeled ability \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Swap to 2H \u2192 Click target if you offed + (Auto Attack) \u2192 Continue with Zerk rotation Note: this section is called \"passive\" auto attacks as they can be weaved relatively passively into your normal rotation. Though, it is not technically \"loseless.\" 5TAA \u2b25 Auto attacks can be used \"actively\" in what's known as 5taa. \u2b25 Similar to mage, the idea is to use a 2H auto attack every other ability, in a pattern of: Auto Attack \u2192 Ability1 \u2192 Ability2 \u2192 Repeat. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, you DO NOT weave them in as regularly as 4TAA autos with Magic https://youtu.be/9cwMPBt6mg0 \u2b25 Ability2 must be a Fastest weapon-speed casted ability, and must not be a channeled ability. \u2b25 Input Ability1 as soon as you see the sword swing animation from the Auto attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Timing will take practice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The only restriction on what the Ability one can be is a less than slower than Fastest weapon-speed channeled ability \u2b25 Here is a video by #Aiex going more in depth of 5TAA and when you would use it, and why you would use it: https://youtu.be/AzswBOuBnUQ Major Downsides of 5TAA to Consider: \u2b25 Slower adrenaline gain: Melee 2h Autos only give 3% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since you are doing an auto every other ability, coupled with standing idle for 2 ticks every other ability, you gain adrenaline at a much slower pace than with traditional rotations. \u2b25 There is no button to force melee auto attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This means you have to stand idle for 1 ticks after Ability2 and wait for the auto attack to come out, and then wait 1 additional tick afterwards before inputting your next ability (thus overall there being a 2t delay between Ability2 and the ability after). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Proper timing will require practice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Input an ability too fast and you lose the Auto attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Input an ability too slow and you lose DPS. \u2b25 These two reasons are why 5taa is a situational technique, though it is still worth mentioning. Choosing a Drygore Ideal Choice \u2b25 It is recommended to use a Drygore Mace and either a Off-hand Drygore Longsword or Off-hand Drygore Rapier. Note: All Drygores have tier 90 ability damage, and if only using abilities, the choice of Drygores would make no difference. Reasoning \u2b25 If considering auto attacks, maces have the fastest attack speed, and a lower auto attack damage, whereas longswords and rapiers have a slower attack speed for a slightly higher auto attack damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The above combination of Drygores is optimal because you should never need mainhand autos, as 2h autos are always preferable, and the faster attack speeds allows for 5 tick auto attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, when making use of freedom autos, then off-hand attack speed is considered.

your normal Barge ability into \u2b25 Greater Barge works as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It will break you free of binds, and where applicable bind a target for 11 ticks (6.6sec) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 By default has a damage range of 25%-125% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, for each tick (0.6sec) since the player stopped attacking their target, Greater Barge gains +10% to its max damage range, and +2% to its min, capping at 10 tick (6s) for +100% and +20%, for a final range of 45%-225% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If it has been atleast 8 ticks (4.8sec) since you stopped attacking it gains another effect, indicated by the Greater Barge icon appearing on your Buff Bar, then it gains an additional effect: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Any melee channeled ability used within 10 ticks (6sec) of casting Greater Barge, indicated by the a Provoke-like icon appearing on your Buff Bar, will be turned into a damage-over-time (DoT) instead \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For the sake of simplicity converting a channeled ability into a DoT is referred to as \"bleeding\" it, or having \"bled\" it, or you are going to \"bleed\" that threshold; however, these should not be confused with normal bleeds (e.g. ), as they are different. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, this is the actual reason Greater Barge is so strong \u2b25 Greater Barge is commonly used as follows, in the following cases: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 First is simply at the start of a fight, as you should not have attacked anything long enough and thus can freely Greater Barge and then convert a channeled ability into a DoT \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Secondly is after any mechanic that forces you to off, such as Vorago's Reflect mechanic, as you again should not have attacked anything long enough allowing you to then Greater Barge freely \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The third case is stalling your rotation mid-combat before you to get the effect within it, which is done as follows: Exploring How to Execute the Third Case Properly \u2b25 Damaging Ability (e.g. ) \u2192 click off atleast 1 tick (0.6sec) before your Defensive \u2192 Defensive (e.g. ) \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Greater Barge \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is important to click off atleast 1 tick prior otherwise you will not get the effect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is thought to be because the game thinks you have tried to cast an auto as a result of the Defensive, and so resets the Greater Barge effect timer \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Also, as seen here, there are 9 ticks (5.4sec) between the the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge, which is 1 more tick (0.6sec) than required \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- So, if said Ability gets you the adrenaline to Berserk , then it is a tick (0.6s) more efficient to do as follows: \u2b25 Damaging Ability (e.g. ) \u2192 wait 2 ticks (1.2sec) \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Greater Barge \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As seen here, there are now 8 ticks (4.8sec) between the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge \u2b25 Here is a demonstration: https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw The Cost of Using Greater Barge \u2b25 In general the cost of utilizing Greater Barge is an Auto in say your Berserk , but in the third case the cost is a Damaging Ability (e.g. ) + your Auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Though the benefit is an extra 4 ticks in say your Berserk which is large enough to be worth said cost Notes on Greater Barge Note: bullets marked with \u2605 are likely bugs, or at the very least unintended \u2b25 Multiple people can stack their Greater Barge bled abilities, unlike what would be possible with normal bleed abilities \u2b25 If you bleed Greater Flurry all the hits will reduce your Berserk cooldown, as you allow its full duration to channel now \u2b25 If you bleed Greater Flurry you need to be careful for a couple reasons: \u2605 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are out of melee distance, it does the equivalent of its AoE (i.e., normal Flurry's) damage, which is far weaker than Greater Flurry's damage per hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Similarly, this occurs if you are adjacent to other targets \u2b25 If you using queuing, if you have no target, ensure to not queue your Greater Barge before TCing and using it, otherwise you will not get the buff to bleed a channeled ability \u2605 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Similar issues occur when clicking over TCing, though likely not a bug, but important to be aware of nonetheless \u2b25 Greater Barge also does not give adrenaline if you still have a target that is dead \u2605 \u2b25 If for whatever reason you were to bleed Frenzy , it only does 180% hits \u2605 \u2b25 Equipping a different tier of weapon after bleeding will change the damage of the weapon according to the latter weapon tier \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This occurs as it is still attempting to cast each hit separately, like a normal channel \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also means each hit has its own chance to hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For example, of you bleed with a t90 weapon equipped, then switch to t92 the damage will be calculated as t92 damage for any remaining hits \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This has some odd interactions with weapons such as Terassaur Maul which will be explored momentarily \u2605 \u2b25 Vorago will not clear these DoTs on reflect \u2b25 The hit timings of Greater Barge bleeds follow a fixed pattern: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first hit's hit timing corresponds with the time it would normally hit as a channeled ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, 2H Assault hit 1 would be 2t (1.2sec) delayed, whereas DW Assault hit 1 would be 3t (1.8sec) delayed \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hits 2-4 will always hit 5t, 7t, and 9t (3sec, 4.2sec, 5.4sec) delayed respectively \u2b25 Further if you stall a barge bleed the following will occur: \u2605 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hits 2-4 will hit as normal on the target you casted the ability on to stall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hit 1 will be the only hit that gets stalled, and when released will hit the same time as it would normally hit if it were the first hit of its channeled ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Furthermore, what this means is you can far-cast your barge bleed on a target to make hits 2-4 hit it from a large distance technically Greater Barge Interation with Weapon Effects \u2b25 For sake of example, Assault and Terassaur Maul will be used; however, this affects any barge bleed and, as far as is known, is caused by the following weapons as well: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bane Weaponry \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Keris \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Darklight \u2b25 Essentially what happens is that after you apply a bleed with one of these weapons, such as a Terassaur Maul , and then you swap weapons, for instance to a T92 weapon (e.g. ), the effect is applied ontop of the t92 weapon's damage for the remaining hits \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As in, with the Terassaur Maul example, if you bleed Assault against a Ranged monster, and then swap to a t92 weapon, for each bleed hit casted with t92 on it will result in t92 + 12.5% damage, rather than T80 + 12.5% damage, which is quite a large increase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, if you bleed with t92, and then swap to the maul , it will just do its normal damage without the modifier being applied","title":"Greater Barge "},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-melee/#deviating-upgrade-paths","text":"Two Roads Diverged in a

Spear of Annihilation if you can bleed at the encounter you are doing \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases the duration of bleeds, which is a relatively decent DPS increase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further it can be a good weapon to bridge the gap between t90 weaponry and Zaros Godsword, given it is far cheaper \u2b25 At high defense bosses such as Vorago, Angel of Death, and Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, it is recommended to pick up a Statius' Warhammer . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It has a special attack which significantly lowers defences for 1 minute. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It also increases your affinity against said target \u2b25 In the end you should aim to grab all three of these upgrades.

Note: You do not need to keep ZGS equipped once you've activated its special attack. Also note that ZGS does not have scythe range. \u2b25 ZGS rotations are similar to Berserk rotations but vary based on the boss. \u2b25 As for adrenaline potions, it is recommended to save adrenaline potions for Berserk as it is more valuable in Berserk with its higher damage modifier.

Vorago, Yakamaru, Beast Master, Angel of Death). \u2b25 Usage of the SWH varies from boss to boss and will be covered more specifically in our boss guides. Greater Fury \u2b25 Greater Fury can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Fury Ability Codex. \u2b25 This does a few things things: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Firstly, Fury is no longer a 3-hit channeled ability and instead only hits once dealing 157% ability damage (the same as the first two hits of the channeled version) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Secondly, the passive 5% critical hit chance increase per channelled hit changes to a single 10% critical hit chance increase on the next hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thirdly, it gains an extra effect where getting a critical hit on Greater Fury gives you a buff which guarantees the first hit of your next ability will crit \u2b25 The main benefit to this upgrade is transforming this ability from a 3-hit (5t/3.0s) channeled ability to a 1-hit non-channeled ability, and so it only requires a GCD to fully use. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows Greater Fury to be used in Revolution++ and Revolution setups without needing to manually cancel the channel after 2 hits. \u2b25 Due to the guaranteed crit effect, it is possible for to be stronger (on average) than a 188% ability ( / / ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is only possible when the crit chance of and the ability damage of the following ability are sufficiently high. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Currently, the only cases where these requirements are met are when you are under the effects of an active Grimoire (and have Biting perk ), and the ability following is either a flanked ability or a charged Greater Barge . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Another niche consideration is when under the effects of Berserk (and ), there is almost no damage difference between \u2192 and 188% \u2192 . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Without the active effects of , is basically always weaker than a 188% ability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Despite this, if you are put into a position where you have no 188% abilities available and need to use , you should consider following it up with a >188% ability to still maximise your damage. *Note: A sheet comparing to / / before various abilities can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1beHYkyPKV-tj8eHlbRDQTRX9GkdFBKhBr89B8fKyuXI/edit#gid=1063393167 * Greater Flurry \u2b25 Greater Flurry can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Flurry Ability Codex. \u2b25 The effect is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Perform a flurry of blows against your surrounding targets, dealing up to 94% weapon damage per hit over 3.6 seconds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If only one target is nearby, up to 157% weapon damage per hit will be dealt instead \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Additionally if an attack hits any target per swing, the cooldown of Berserk will be reduced by 1.2 seconds each swing \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is these last two bullets which make it worthwhile \u2b25 Once you've unlocked this threshold, it becomes your 3rd best threshold in Berserk. \u2b25 In addition, its unique effect of reducing Berserk cooldown is very useful in overall Melee rotations. \u2b25 There are several ways of using GFlurry. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can either cancel it on GCD (ie. 2 hits) for burst damage, or use it for its entire duration for its Berserk reduction effect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further you can 5t it (3 hit/3 sec), primarily used to align your ticks in Berserk after using a full channel like Destroy to still use all ticks of your ultimate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you bleed this threshold using gBarge, all bleed hits will contribute towards reducing Berserk's cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is used extensively at places like AoD and Solak where players want to Berserk as often as possible through out the fight.

Lunging 4 \u2b25 Lunging is a perk unlocked via Invention at level 89. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The effect is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The maximum damage of Combust, Dismember and Fragmentation shot is incrased by 20% weapon damage per rank, but enemies that move will only take 1.5x increased damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This goes up to rank 4. \u2b25 The only basic bleed in melee affected by Lunging is Dismember . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since Dismember cannot be walked to gain bonus damage, the effects of Lunging will always activate for Dismember, thus it is strictly an upgrade over non-lunging Dismember. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In fact, the effect of Lunging is extra strong on Dismember because Dismember cannot be walked (the same applies to the 99 Strength Cape effect). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- With Lunging 4 and Strength Cape effect combined, Dismember becomes the strongest basic ability for melee outside of Berserk. \u2b25 Dismember should be used outside Berserk as bleeds do not get boosted damage (Dismember has a 15s cooldown so you should plan to use Dismember before a Berserk, then 20s later, use Dismember after a Berserk). \u2b25 The goal is to have near 100% uptime of the Dismember effect when using Lunging4 + Strength Cape. \u2b25 A Dual Wield Off-hand switch should be used for this perk and later upgraded to a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation due to it further extending the duration of Dismember.","title":"Weapon Switch Invention Perks"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-melee/#auto-attacks","text":"What They are and When to Use Them \u2b25 Once you've incorporated DW/2h Switching, auto attacks become more prevelant as a dps tool. \u2b25 When you can auto attack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: Fastest (e.g. drygore mainhand ) = 4t, Average (e.g. ) = 6t. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each time you do a Damaging Ability, it resets this cooldown. \u2b25 We will be using 2H auto attacks as they deal more damage. \u2b25 There are two specific instances of when you want to incorporate auto attacks into your rotation; one is 'passive', the other will is 5taa. 'Passive' Auto Attacks \u2b25 By performing a non-damaging ability, the auto attack cooldown is not reset, yet a GCD is 3t. \u2b25 So, during the GCD, assuming the ability before was non-channeled and cast with either Fast or Fastest speed weapons you will get an auto attack during your GCD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is because the respective cooldowns are 5t (3 sec) and 4t (2.4 sec), yet the GCD of the ability prior to the non-damaging ability will cover the first 3t of the cooldown, so the cooldown will end during the GCD caused by the non-damaging ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, you will have to click the boss if you somehow \"offed\" (e.g., by clicking under you) from it to get the auto \u2b25 Auto attacks can deal up to 5k damage, 8k in a Berserk and in most cases is worth the 2t wait. \u2b25 You can perform an auto attack on every Berserk activation by doing the following: Fast/Fastest weapon speed non-channeled ability \u2192 Berserk \u2192 Swap to 2H \u2192 Click target if you offed + (Auto Attack) \u2192 Continue with Zerk rotation Note: this section is called \"passive\" auto attacks as they can be weaved relatively passively into your normal rotation. Though, it is not technically \"loseless.\" 5TAA \u2b25 Auto attacks can be used \"actively\" in what's known as 5taa. \u2b25 Similar to mage, the idea is to use a 2H auto attack every other ability, in a pattern of: Auto Attack \u2192 Ability1 \u2192 Ability2 \u2192 Repeat. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, you DO NOT weave them in as regularly as 4TAA autos with Magic https://youtu.be/9cwMPBt6mg0 \u2b25 Ability2 must be a Fastest weapon-speed casted ability, and must not be a channeled ability. \u2b25 Input Ability1 as soon as you see the sword swing animation from the Auto attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Timing will take practice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The only restriction on what the Ability one can be is a less than slower than Fastest weapon-speed channeled ability \u2b25 Here is a video by #Aiex going more in depth of 5TAA and when you would use it, and why you would use it: https://youtu.be/AzswBOuBnUQ Major Downsides of 5TAA to Consider: \u2b25 Slower adrenaline gain: Melee 2h Autos only give 3% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since you are doing an auto every other ability, coupled with standing idle for 2 ticks every other ability, you gain adrenaline at a much slower pace than with traditional rotations. \u2b25 There is no button to force melee auto attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This means you have to stand idle for 1 ticks after Ability2 and wait for the auto attack to come out, and then wait 1 additional tick afterwards before inputting your next ability (thus overall there being a 2t delay between Ability2 and the ability after). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Proper timing will require practice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Input an ability too fast and you lose the Auto attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Input an ability too slow and you lose DPS. \u2b25 These two reasons are why 5taa is a situational technique, though it is still worth mentioning.","title":"Auto Attacks"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-melee/#choosing-a-drygore","text":"Ideal Choice \u2b25 It is recommended to use a Drygore Mace and either a Off-hand Drygore Longsword or Off-hand Drygore Rapier.

Reasoning \u2b25 If considering auto attacks, maces have the fastest attack speed, and a lower auto attack damage, whereas longswords and rapiers have a slower attack speed for a slightly higher auto attack damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The above combination of Drygores is optimal because you should never need mainhand autos, as 2h autos are always preferable, and the faster attack speeds allows for 5 tick auto attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, when making use of freedom autos, then off-hand attack speed is considered.","title":"Choosing a Drygore"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-melee/#gem-rotations","text":"Note: These are not going to necessarily translate to boss rotations, but it can help aid you in getting an idea of to make use of your abilities 5 Minute 0% Start Melee Rotation (Courtesy of #RexT) 5 Minute 0% Start No Mutated/Sigil/ZGS (Courtesy of #RexT) Basic Gems https://youtu.be/vLby8g5RNRU (Courtesy of RSN Mateooo) https://youtu.be/r4_8w3jwAnI (Courtesy of #RexT) https://youtu.be/YRuCFmXOA3I (Sigil; Courtesy of #RexT) No ZGS/Enh Apot/Mutated Abilities https://youtu.be/5gX2iBeToPk (#RexT) Prioritization Note: This is distinct from ordering and only explains which abilities are good in a vacuum.","title":"Gem Rotations"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-range/","text":"Dpm advice range Introduction In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

Repeat. \u2b25 Follow this simple repeating pattern as a standard base to follow in Combat Dummies to reach 150k DPM: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build to 100% \u2192 Death Swiftness \u2192 Thresholds \u2192 Repeat. One can expect to reach around 150k DPM with low to medium player input. Full Manual Why to Use Full Manual \u2b25 Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player. \u2b25 The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario. \u2b25 Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode. How to Approach Using Full Manual \u2b25 While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Refer to the revolution bars as examples. \u2b25 Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice. \u2b25 Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution. \u2b25 An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough. \u2b25 Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta). There is no easy \"trick\" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it! Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation Ability Priorization \u2b25 Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again \u2013 during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. \u2b25 To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND short cooldowns, in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. \u2b25 See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum): Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons. Building a Rotation \u2b25 When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. \u2b25 Filler abilities such as Needle Strike and Dazing Shot should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Snipe , Corruption Shot , Binding Shot-Flanking , and Fragmentation Shot-Walk . \u2b25 Any basic ability with damage lower than Needle/Dazing would be considered a weak ability, such as Piercing Shot , Tuska's Wrath , Sacrifice , Binding Shot without Flanking, Richochet on a single target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally speaking, these should be avoided \u2b25 If you are 2h or dual wield camping you will be limited to only one filler ability (Dazing Shot / or Needle Strike , respectively). Thus, try to utilize Dazing Shot or Needle Strike as often as possible in your rotations. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A basic pattern of Needle Strike \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. \u2b25 For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Needle and Dazing / as filler abilities. Giving you access to stronger rotations. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Needle Strike \u2192 Ability \u2192 Dazing Shot \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat will give you strong dps. Bakriminel Bolts Enchanted bakriminel bolts provide various effects which can be very useful in certain pvm scenarios. If you are using bolt carrying weapons, it is highly recommended that you bring these bolts for increased DPM. Note: If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta . Ruby Bolts Overall the best bolts for general PvM. A 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups. The HP to switch at varies per target, and it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt once the overriden hits are lower than expected. Note: Rubies are banned from combat dummy gems as its difficult to accurately measure your DPM with their effects. Onyx Bolts A 10% chance to activate, increasing damage by 25% on activation and healing for the same amount. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after Rubies are no longer effective. Hydrix Bolts A 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness . 130k/140k DPM Priorizing Thresholds \u2b25 At this stage it is very important to learn a good ultimate rotation. It is encouraged in a 5 minute gem to do 5 Death's Swiftness, if you haven't already, you should get a Planted Feet switch in order to gain +8 seconds on your Death's Swiftness. \u2b25 Learning which thresholds to prioritize and use in an Ultimate is extremely important to maximize your dpm. It is critical to focus on being able to fit in 6 thresholds in a Swiftness with an Adrenaline Potion, and 5 thresholds without an Adrenaline potion. Not having a planted feet switch will also cut your ultimates short by 1 threshold, generally speaking. Its heavily recommended to familiarize yourself with the strength of your abilities in: #unknown-channel . Note: This section assumes no Flanking Switches Your threshold order in Death's Swiftness should be: \u2b25 With Adrenaline Potion: Rapid Fire \u2192 Snapshot \u2192 Shadow Tendrils \u2192 Rapid Fire \u2192 Bombardment \u2192 Snapshot \u2b25 Without Adrenaline Potion: Snapshot \u2192 Shadow Tendrils \u2192 Rapid Fire \u2192 Snapshot \u2192 Bombardment 150k/160k DPM Invention Perks At this stage, pushing to the next will almost certainly require the usage of a Planted Feet switch, as well as a Flanking switch. Once flanking can be used, the threshold prioritization in ultimates is as follows: \u2b25 With Adrenaline Potion: Snapshot \u200e \u200e> Rapid Fire > Shadow Tendrils > Tight Bindings > Snapshot > Rapid Fire \u2b25 Without Adrenaline Potion: Snapshot > Shadow Tendrils > Rapid Fire > Snapshot > Tight Bindings \u2b25 Notes: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We remove Bombardment from our threshold rotations as they are all replaced with Flanking . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Remember to use your Flanking switch for basics, not just for thresholds. Using it on Binding Shot improves that ability from 100% ability damage to 260% ability damage and is often overlooked by inexperienced players.

Shadow Tendrils What Makes It Special Tendrils , despite deal damage, acts as a non-damaging ability with a couple caveats. \u2b25 This allows you to use what is colloqually referred to as \"Defensive Autos\" with it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These are simply lossless autos that fire during non-damaging abilities as they do not reset your Auto cooldown. How It Works \u2b25 To get your Auto with Shadow Tendrils you must perform a non-channeled fastest speed weapon ability before Tendrils . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For example, Needle with Blightbound Crossbows . \u2b25 To further make use of this interaction, you want to ensure that this Auto is a 2h-Auto, such as SGB or ECB , or Dbow (where accuracy permits). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To do this, simply swap to your 2h after your ability before Tendrils , or swap to your 2h directly as you or after you cast Tendrils . Differences From Typical Non-Damaging Abilities As mentioned prior, there are some caveats to this ability and they are as follows: \u2b25 You cannot delay the Auto with Tendrils like other Defensive Autos. \u2b25 Fast speed weapons do not work like with other Defensive Autos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, the non-channeled ability before Tendrils must be fastest. \u2b25 You have to spam click if you want to get Auto after Tendrils if you offed for some reason before it, though clicking once before Tendrils works too.","title":"Dpm advice range"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-range/#dpm-advice-range","text":"","title":"Dpm advice range"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-range/#introduction","text":"In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible.

High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again \u2013 during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. \u2b25 To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND short cooldowns, in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. \u2b25 See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum): Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons. Building a Rotation \u2b25 When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. \u2b25 Filler abilities such as Needle Strike and Dazing Shot should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Snipe , Corruption Shot , Binding Shot-Flanking , and Fragmentation Shot-Walk . \u2b25 Any basic ability with damage lower than Needle/Dazing would be considered a weak ability, such as Piercing Shot , Tuska's Wrath , Sacrifice , Binding Shot without Flanking, Richochet on a single target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally speaking, these should be avoided \u2b25 If you are 2h or dual wield camping you will be limited to only one filler ability (Dazing Shot / or Needle Strike , respectively).

Categorized as mid tier PvM, the encounter is useful for anyone wanting to learn how to deal with large mobs as well as bosses, combining aspects of single target and AoE damage. The three bosses of the Laboratory drop the Greater Flurry, Greater Fury and Greater Barge codices in the order that they appear, improving your Melee techniques vital to end-game PvM Each solo run of ED2 is worth 9,276,146 in uniques. Advanced players can get up to 4 kph, earning on average 37,104,586 gp/hr. General Notes \u2b25 The rotations listed for the bosses are for an advanced setup, lower tiered set-ups will require improvisation. \u2b25 It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double Surge to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia. \u2b25 You can Surge or Bladed Dive a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry. Presets Beginner/Group Magic \u2b25 Food can be swapped out for Spiritual Prayers as needed. \u2b25 Cinderbanes can be camped for the full dungeon. \u2b25 Generally solid food is fine, as you are typically only healing between encounters, so the adrenaline loss is acceptable. \u2b25 More charms can be brought if needed. \u2b25 If lacking an Essence of Finality , bring both an Amulet of Souls for mobs, and Reaper for bosses.

Laboratory Slime \u2b25 Life Points : 20,000 (Spawnlings: 10,000) \u2b25 Special Attack : After every odd-numbered auto attack they will spawn a smaller slime with similar damage output. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If killed, these spawnlings do not count toward opening any barriers. \u2b25 They attack with rapid, low-damage melee attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As they often spawn in groups their damage will quickly stack up if not dealt with or evaded. Lava Spider \u2b25 Life Points : 15,000 \u2b25 They attack with very rapid, low-damage ranged attacks with very long range. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As they often spawn in groups their damage will quickly stack up if not dealt with or evaded. \u2b25 There are no critical path barriers that require Lava Spiders to be defeated. If the goal is fast, full runs, all Lava Spiders can be ignored. Chromatic Dragons \u2b25 Life Points : Red Dragon: 29,000; Black Dragon: 39,000 \u2b25 These are very basic and have no mechanical differences compared to overworld counterparts. \u2b25 They attack with moderate-damage melee and magic attacks. Magma Golem \u2b25 Life Points : 20,000 \u2b25 They are much weaker in general compared to their Lost Grove counterparts and have no special attacks. \u2b25 They attack with moderate-damage, halberd-range melee attacks. Animated Book \u2b25 Life Points : 15,000 \u2b25 A basic, high damage output enemy. \u2b25 They attack with moderate-damage melee , ranged , and magic attacks. Celestial Dragon \u2b25 Life Points : 48,000 \u2b25 The melee and magic defence of ED2 celestial dragons is drastically reduced compared to their counterparts on Dragontooth Isle. \u2b25 Special Attack : After being damaged under 36,000 life points, rapidly heal 2,400 life points per tick for 9 ticks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This special attack will be repeated every 6 auto attacks after its first use. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This effect can be canceled early or prevented alltogether by stunning or binding the dragon as or before it occurs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Most stuns and binds will cancel this effect including: Stunning/binding abilities, binding spells , or Sticky Bombs . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They do not have access to the special attack of the celestial dragons in the Dragontooth Isle resource dungeon. \u2b25 They attack with moderate-damage melee and magic attacks. Lava Strykewyrm \u2b25 Life Points : 30,000 \u2b25 These are significantly weaker than their counterparts near the Lava Maze, and cannot use any of their special attacks. \u2b25 They attack with moderate-damage magic attacks. Gemstone Dragons \u2b25 Life Points : Dragonstone Dragon: 55,000; Onyx Dragon: 60,000; Hydrix Dragon: 75,000 \u2b25 The melee and magic defence of ED2 gemstone dragons is drastically reduced compared to their counterparts on Karamja. \u2b25 Each gemstone dragon has a special, slow moving, 3x3 aoe attack with an extra effect. They will not use this attack in melee distance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dragonstone Dragon: Reduces antifire potion timers. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Onyx Dragon: Heals the dragon. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hydrix Dragon: Drains adrenaline to 0% and temporarily halves adrenaline gain. \u2b25 They each attack with moderate-damage melee and magic attacks. Section 1 Room 1 \u2b25 Lure Slimes to AoE them, kill 4 to proceed. Room 2 \u2b25 Surge Bladed Dive to the staircase to avoid aggroing Spiders and Sunshine on the edge of the wall, \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Kill 3 Red Dragons to proceed. Room 2.5 \u2b25 Walk around the wall back into the Sunshine you placed earlier and finish your rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you have Slimes following you, you need to Surge past the Red Dragons and they will get blocked behind them. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Slimes get blocked very easily which can be utilized multiple times throughout the section. Room 3 \u2b25 Surge to the back of the bridge and Detonate Tsunami . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You only need to kill 4 Golems to proceed but you can catch them all in AoE's very easily. Room 4 \u2b25 The optimal way to do this room depends on the positioning of the Slimes and books right as the barrier goes down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are immediately aggroed by multiple Slimes and Books: Entangle and clear them from the bridge. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you draw only Slime aggro, look to Surge Bladed Dive behind the Celestial (Slimes will get blocked). \u2b25 You must kill the Celestial + several Slimes to pass this room so if you draw no aggro at all you must manually tag some slimes to bring behind the Celestial. Room 5 \u2b25 Most of the time you will have extra enemies following you from the previous room so Surge past the 3 Celestials and Sunshine at the back of the room (extra books, slimes, golems will be blocked). \u2b25 Sunshine there and clear the Celestials. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can use Dominion Mines for the dragon. Room 6 \u2b25 Deal damage as normal, Sunshine if you'd like. Note: Room 6 actually occurs after Astellarn. Astellarn, the First Celestial The first encounter of the Laboratory, This fight heavily utilizes punishing area-of-effect mechanics but is still very straightforward and easy to master with some practice. Additionally, he drops the Greater Flurry Codex . Mechanics \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Pulsar: Spawned after 2-3 autoattacks, it has 20,000 hp, dealing moderate periodic damage. Shortly after, a bar will appear above the player's head and a Wyrmhole will spawn at their current location when it fills. This special attack is cast based upon the time you entered the dungeon, potentially de-syncing with the Neutron Star. Placing the wyrmhole along these lines will prevent it from being blocked out by the later rain mechanic. Pulsar pulsing its firey waves \u2b25 Neutron Star: This will follow the player around and must be lured into the Wyrmhole, stabilizing it, turning white, and giving increased damage to Astellarn. This special attack is cast based upon the time you started the fight with Astellarn, potentially de-syncing with the Wyrmhole. If it touches a player, it will explode, dealing 5000 damage. Its highly recommended to teleport out and restart the fight if this happens. \u2b25 Celestial Rain: Once the boss reaches 200,000 HP, Asterllarn will take decreased damage and spawn a continuous rain in a random quadrant that deals increasing damage as long as it is stood in. This will change quadrants occasionally and will only be a major issue if the Wyrmhole was placed improperly. From here on, these mechanics repeat with the rain lasting for the remainder of the encounter. Section 2 Room 1 \u2b25 Spider aggro can be a nuisance here, Surge Bladed Dive immediately East here and depending on how many Spiders come along you may need to clear them first. \u2b25 Clear the two Lava Strykes at the end to proceed. If lots of aggro is drawn, stand here to stack. Room 2 \u2b25 Sunshine in the middle of the Black Dragons and clear them. Room 3 \u2b25 Surge to the end of the path while killing the Dragons and Sunshine when it comes up. \u2b25 You need to kill every Black Dragon here to proceed. Room 4 \u2b25 You must kill 4/6 Lava Strykes to proceed, Sunshine at the end of the path right next to the barrier to clear the last two. Room 5 \u2b25 Your Sunshine from the previous room will still be ongoing to clear the 3 Black Dragons at the start. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 build to 100 at the last Dragon at the end of the path in preparation for Verak Lith. Verak Lith The second encounter of the Laboratory, his attack rotation is very predictable but deals consistent moderately high damage so it is recommended to learn the few mechanics properly to avoid any unnecessary deaths. Additionally he drops the Greater Fury Codex . It will always melee auto attack when the player is in melee distance and always mage otherwise. The auto attacks hit quite hard and specifically the mage ones are desynced visually so it is important to not mess up too many prayer flicks here. Verak Lith's Attack Rotation 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Spire \u2192 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Ricochet \u2192 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Spire \u2192 4 Auto Attacks \u2192 Nosedive/Hurricanes \u2192 Repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Spire : The message \"Verak Lith slams his tail against the ground, the earth shakes beneath your feet!\" will appear and after a short delay and spire with 15,000 hp will spawn near the player. The boss will be immune to damage while the spire is alive so it is good to threshold to get it down immediately. The spawn will also be accompanied by a moderate melee hit that can be Resonanced . In a typical kill, this will be the primary method alongside Soul Split flicking to restore HP. \u2b25 Ricochet : Verak Lith will send out a projectile that lands at a spot around the player after a few seconds. The element of this projectile can be poison, ice, or shock, and corresponds with the three groups of eggs found around the arena. The correct way to deal with this mechanic is to pick up the projectile and interact with a different type of egg to disperse it before the bar fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Missing the projectile will deal 4000 damage and missing the dispersal can deal 9000+ damage so it is especially important not to miss the second half of this mechanic. Generally, if the projectile matches the element of the nearest group of eggs to the player, it should be ignored with Disruption Shield , Debilitate , or Reflect (or nothing if the player is high HP). This will end the mechanic early. A player picks up the projectile \u2b25 Nosedive : A message will appear on the screen mentioning that a dragon is nosediving. An arrow will show up near the player to indicate the direction the dragon is approaching from and, after a short delay, a thin line of dragonbreath will be fired along the line the arrow is pointing. This can deal over 8000 magic damage and can be avoided by simply moving out of the way. However, the arrow will adjust it's position based on the player's movement for a short period so it is recommended to learn the timing on this mechanic and move as it goes off. \u2b25 Hurricanes : Verak Lith will say \"Let the flames melt the flesh from your bones\" and engulf the area around the player in fire. This will deal no damage but after a short delay, hurricanes will spawn in the area that deal extremely high damage and last for roughly 20 seconds. This is a fairly large area attack and should be surged from to be a safe distance away. It isn't very complicated however, simply don't touch a hurricane. Projectile is fired Hurricanes unleashed Section 3 \u2b25 Really straightforward just spam Dominion Mines and Sunshine at those spots. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can skip the two Onyx Dragons at the start and the other two Hydrix Dragons in the middle. Black Stone Dragon The Black Stone Dragon is the final boss encounter in the Dragonkin Laboratory and is the main source of the dungeon's primary unique: Draconic Energies , which are used to make the Mage T92 Elite Tectonic set . Alongside dropping the Greater Barge Codex , which sees frequent use in endgame melee encounters. This fight consists of fairly simple mechanics but can be very punishing if mistakes are made. It is also one of the few bosses to auto attack in all three combat styles, with melee hitting especially hard, so it is possible to die just from auto attacks if the player can't outheal with soul split, is low on food, and/or can't prayer flick the fight. Attack Rotation \u2b25 Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 3 Auto Attacks \u2192 Gemstone Spikes \u2192 2 Auto Attacks \u2192 Dragonbreath \u2192 Repeat \u2b25 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Black Hands \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1-5 Auto Attacks \u2192 Smoke Spiral \u2192 3 Auto Attacks \u2192 Mage AoE \u2192 2 Auto Attacks \u2192 Dragonbreath \u2192 Gemstone Spikes \u2192 3 Auto Attacks \u2192 Mage AoE \u2192 Repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Gemstone Spikes : This mechanic occurs a few auto attacks into the start of the fight and after each dragonbreath after phase 1. This is identical to the hydrix dragon special attack where a line of spikes are shot through the ground and erupt under the player. This deals 5000+ melee damage and drains all adrenaline upon impact. It will also apply a debuff that reduces all adrenaline gain by 50% for a short duration. Simply move out of the way when this comes out. \u2b25 Dragonbreath : The skybox will turn dark blue and Black Stone Dragon will fire a 100% accuracy mage attack that deals moderate damage. This is essentially just a mage auto attack that hits slightly harder but signals that the spikes are coming out immediately after (phase 3). \u2b25 Black Hands (Phase 2): Phase 2 will begin as Black Stone Dragon's first attack after reaching 520k HP. This is signaled by Black Stone Dragon moving to the center of the arena and 4 black hands with 80,000 hp each spawning where the rocks are located. These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal rapid 2000+ damage if stood on. These hands will never reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured below. The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1. \u2b25 Smoke Spiral : A line of smoke will spiral inwards towards Black Stone Dragon, dealing 4000+ damage per tick if stood on. The boss will remain stationary during this time so Flanking is possible here. It is recommended to learn where you can stand safely to avoid having to cancel channeled abilities. Generally, a max range Sunshine to the sides of the boss will provide decent freedom of movement and allow for Flanking \u2b25 Mage AoE : Black Stone Dragon will call out \"GET. OUT. OF. ME.\" or \"The shadow overwhelms!\" and turn to fire a black projectile towards a random spot in the arena. This is very similar to Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will explode into black tendrils that deal 4000+ damage in the area for a short period. In a solo encounter, this will miss most of the time and isn't a big concern. The boss can also be flanked when it turns to send out the special. \u2b25 Fly : Upon hitting 260,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon will become invulnerable and fly around the arena, landing at various spots and sending out smoke lines towards the player each time. Additional lines will also spawn out of existing ones on each land, so movement can get hectic if the boss lands at the same area multiple times. This smoke is functionally identical to the type in the spiral mechanic and should be avoided at all costs. This will occur 7 times before the boss becomes vulnerable again and continues the phase 3 rotation starting from Smoke Spiral. The lines will not spawn if the boss lands out of range but it is still highly recommended to follow and use an ability after each landing as the boss will take longer to fly again if the player stays far away.

Its highly recommended to teleport out and restart the fight if this happens. \u2b25 Celestial Rain: Once the boss reaches 200,000 HP, Asterllarn will take decreased damage and spawn a continuous rain in a random quadrant that deals increasing damage as long as it is stood in.

Additionally he drops the Greater Fury Codex . It will always melee auto attack when the player is in melee distance and always mage otherwise. The auto attacks hit quite hard and specifically the mage ones are desynced visually so it is important to not mess up too many prayer flicks here.

The boss will be immune to damage while the spire is alive so it is good to threshold to get it down immediately. The spawn will also be accompanied by a moderate melee hit that can be Resonanced . In a typical kill, this will be the primary method alongside Soul Split flicking to restore HP. \u2b25 Ricochet : Verak Lith will send out a projectile that lands at a spot around the player after a few seconds. The element of this projectile can be poison, ice, or shock, and corresponds with the three groups of eggs found around the arena. The correct way to deal with this mechanic is to pick up the projectile and interact with a different type of egg to disperse it before the bar fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Missing the projectile will deal 4000 damage and missing the dispersal can deal 9000+ damage so it is especially important not to miss the second half of this mechanic. Generally, if the projectile matches the element of the nearest group of eggs to the player, it should be ignored with Disruption Shield , Debilitate , or Reflect (or nothing if the player is high HP). This will end the mechanic early. A player picks up the projectile \u2b25 Nosedive : A message will appear on the screen mentioning that a dragon is nosediving. An arrow will show up near the player to indicate the direction the dragon is approaching from and, after a short delay, a thin line of dragonbreath will be fired along the line the arrow is pointing. This can deal over 8000 magic damage and can be avoided by simply moving out of the way. However, the arrow will adjust it's position based on the player's movement for a short period so it is recommended to learn the timing on this mechanic and move as it goes off. \u2b25 Hurricanes : Verak Lith will say \"Let the flames melt the flesh from your bones\" and engulf the area around the player in fire. This will deal no damage but after a short delay, hurricanes will spawn in the area that deal extremely high damage and last for roughly 20 seconds. This is a fairly large area attack and should be surged from to be a safe distance away. It isn't very complicated however, simply don't touch a hurricane.

Alongside dropping the Greater Barge Codex , which sees frequent use in endgame melee encounters. This fight consists of fairly simple mechanics but can be very punishing if mistakes are made. It is also one of the few bosses to auto attack in all three combat styles, with melee hitting especially hard, so it is possible to die just from auto attacks if the player can't outheal with soul split, is low on food, and/or can't prayer flick the fight.

This is identical to the hydrix dragon special attack where a line of spikes are shot through the ground and erupt under the player. This deals 5000+ melee damage and drains all adrenaline upon impact. It will also apply a debuff that reduces all adrenaline gain by 50% for a short duration. Simply move out of the way when this comes out. \u2b25 Dragonbreath : The skybox will turn dark blue and Black Stone Dragon will fire a 100% accuracy mage attack that deals moderate damage. This is essentially just a mage auto attack that hits slightly harder but signals that the spikes are coming out immediately after (phase 3). \u2b25 Black Hands (Phase 2): Phase 2 will begin as Black Stone Dragon's first attack after reaching 520k HP. This is signaled by Black Stone Dragon moving to the center of the arena and 4 black hands with 80,000 hp each spawning where the rocks are located. These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal rapid 2000+ damage if stood on. These hands will never reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured below. The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1. \u2b25 Smoke Spiral : A line of smoke will spiral inwards towards Black Stone Dragon, dealing 4000+ damage per tick if stood on. The boss will remain stationary during this time so Flanking is possible here. It is recommended to learn where you can stand safely to avoid having to cancel channeled abilities. Generally, a max range Sunshine to the sides of the boss will provide decent freedom of movement and allow for Flanking \u2b25 Mage AoE : Black Stone Dragon will call out \"GET. OUT. OF. ME.\" or \"The shadow overwhelms!\" and turn to fire a black projectile towards a random spot in the arena. This is very similar to Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will explode into black tendrils that deal 4000+ damage in the area for a short period. In a solo encounter, this will miss most of the time and isn't a big concern. The boss can also be flanked when it turns to send out the special. \u2b25 Fly : Upon hitting 260,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon will become invulnerable and fly around the arena, landing at various spots and sending out smoke lines towards the player each time. Additional lines will also spawn out of existing ones on each land, so movement can get hectic if the boss lands at the same area multiple times. This smoke is functionally identical to the type in the spiral mechanic and should be avoided at all costs. This will occur 7 times before the boss becomes vulnerable again and continues the phase 3 rotation starting from Smoke Spiral. The lines will not spawn if the boss lands out of range but it is still highly recommended to follow and use an ability after each landing as the boss will take longer to fly again if the player stays far away.","title":"Black Stone Dragon"},{"location":"pvme-guides/elite-dungeons/dragonkin-laboratory-magic/#example-run","text":"https://youtu.be/lsris6thu8g - 18:02 no food no bank run by #Linie https://youtu.be/rQDaUsbrbQM - 14:38 by #Onyksi","title":"Example Run"},{"location":"pvme-guides/elite-dungeons/dragonkin-laboratory-melee/","text":"Dragonkin laboratory melee Dragonkin Laboratory (Courtesy of #Terpsichore) Introduction The second Elite Dungeon released, the Dragonkin Laboratory is a relatively straightforward encounter.

Section 1 In terms of raw damage intake, Section 1 has some of the most strenuous and intense rooms in the dungeon. Laboratory Slimes, Spiders, and Magma Golems can stack up their damage extremely quickly, and the Celestial dragons can output a lot of damage in their own right. If committed to using Erethdor's grimoire in the dungeon, it may still be worth camping Scrimshaw of vampyrism in the more populated rooms, if only to prevent having to eat through all of your supplies before Astellarn. Room 1 (Defeat 4 Laboratory Slimes) \u2b25 Surge forward into the chest then cut the corner by Bladed Diving down the steps. \u2b25 Only 3 slimes spawn on either side of the room, so at least one must be lured to the other side to aoe enough to clear the barrier. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage from laboratory slimes will rapidly stack up if the room is not dealt with quickly. \u2192 \u2192 (If necessary) + \u2192 Room 2 (Defeat 3 Red Dragons) \u2b25 A safe, consistent way to handle this room is to Surge down the steps, Bladed Dive toward the red dragon on the second set of stairs, and Surge down to the wall down the stairs. This will consistently lure the other two red dragons together at the top of the stairs to easily aoe them. \u2b25 Berserk as soon as possible against the first red dragon, continue your berserk using aoes against the next two, and finish your berserk on the red dragons past this barrier. + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (on-task) \u2192 (build) \u2192 + \u2192 (aoe) Room 3 (Defeat 4 Red Dragons) \u2b25 Finish your Berserk while aoeing the closest pack of 3 red dragons.

Apply your bleeds, preferably walking Slaughter , and then use a sticky bomb to pre-bind it. If executed correctly, you may finish off the celestial and two slimes with aoes as the sticky bomb will cancel the celestial dragon's healing special attack. \u2b25 Damage will add up very quickly in this room. Watch your life points and finish it quickly. (walked) \u2192 (bleeds) + \u2192 (aoe) Room 6 (Defeat 3 Celestial Dragons) \u2b25 After clearing the barrier, use a defensive ability and Surge through the door.

Use aoes to clear the 3 celestial dragons. \u2192 \u2192 (aoe) + (spam) Room 7 (Defeat 1 Celestial Dragon) \u2b25 Ideally, use a Sticky bomb , finish your Berserk on the next dragon, and finish it with bleeds and thresholds.

This is applied following her first auto attack after she is damaged under 200k life points. \u2b25 Pulsar - Astellarn spawns small orange orb with 20k life points that periodically deals moderate \"cannon-type\" damage and is successible to \u200e \u200eDominion mines . It is highly recommended to kill this soon after it spawns. \u2b25 Celestial Rain - Upon reaching 200k life points, Astellarn will targets a quadrant of the boss room with a low-damaging typeless-damage aoe effect that ramps up if stood in for too long. \u2b25 Wyrmhole - Astellarn will mark a player with a blue bar. When the bar empties it will drop a black circle on the floor that deals moderate typeless damage when stood in. \u2b25 Neutron Star - A small black orb with an orange trail that will explode, dealing severe typeless damage to the player that came in contact with it. Must be lured into the wyrmhole to progress the boss fight. \u2b25 White Hole - Once the Neutron star is lured into the Wyrmhole, the aoe will turn white. When a player stands on top of it, Astellarn's damage reduction will be removed, and the player's damage output will be boosted even further. Note: Due to the way the attack timing is determined, it is possible for the wyrmhole and neutron star to desynchonize. Be aware that it is possible, but very rare, for the neutron star to spawn before the wyrmhole is placed. Strategy \u2b25 Astellarn can be a very punishing and complex boss \u200e \u200efor beginners, especially when using melee, but once the mechanics are understood and handled properly she becomes a very consistent encounter. \u2b25 Unlike most bosses, Astellarn's boss fight timer does not start until she is attacked. Keeping this in mind, it is still important to start the boss fight as soon as possible, both for overall dungeon clear time, and because it is possible for slimes from previous rooms to follow you into the boss room if they are not blocked by a celestial dragon, stopped by sticky bombs before the boss room, or stopped by the barrier that closes once the boss fight begins. \u2b25 The beginning of the fight is straightforward. Referring to the image, it is highly recommended to only stand in the area highlighted by green. Due to a quirk in Astellarn's auto attack AI, she will only attack with magic autos while you are standing in the green area, while standing anywhere else will allow her to use all of magic , ranged , and \u200e \u200emelee autos. Standing in this area significantly reduces her damage output on you, and makes soul split flicking her attacks much easier. \u2b25 The goal of the first part of the boss fight is to damage Astellarn to under 200k life points (upon which she will gain massive damage reduction) before she spawns her first pulsar. Regardless of her life points, when the pulsar spawns, use dismember on it, drop your dominion mines, and finish it off with basics. Generally by the time this is accomplished, Astellarn will have already marked you with a secondary bar under your adrenaline that counts down until an aoe damaging \"Wyrmhole\" is placed underneath you. \u2b25 Ideally, this wyrmhole is placed in melee distance, on one of the axes denoted in the image by red, perpendicular lines. The best placement location for this special attack on the axis marked by a red \"X\" on the image. This placement ensures that the next mechanic, the Neutron star, will not spawn on top of you, ruining the kill. \u2b25 Once the wyrmhole is placed, build adrenaline for berserk and lure the slow moving Neutron star toward the wyrmhole. Once the Neutron star moves into the Wyrmhole, the aoe on the ground will turn white and boost the damage you deal while you stand on top of it. Following this, use Berserk + Adrenaline renewal \u2192 , and finish your Berserk rotation. Rotations \u2b25 Phase 1 (dw) + \u2192 (4taa) + \u2192 (t92) \u2192 188s \u2192 s \u2192 r + to prephase Note: Must be \"fastest\" mh speed to 4taa after barge; dbane will not work. \u2b25 Pulsar + \u2192 basics \u2192 into position for wyrmhole \u2b25 Phase 1.5 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build to 100%. If needed, and/or Astellarn's auto attacks while waiting for the Neutron star to be lured. If you have a lot of extra adrenaline, it's possible to apply bleeds to the boss for some extra damage during and after luring the neutron star. \u2b25 Phase 2 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (t92) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 or unequip-armor at approx. 35,000 life points Note: This rotation should net consistent approximately 50 second kills or better. Room 10 (Defeat 2 Celestials) \u2b25 Surge toward the two celestial dragons. Use your bleeds on the first one, walk Slaughter , and use a Sticky bomb to cancel its special attack. Use aoe abilities, thresholds, and sticky bombs to finish them off. \u2192 (walked) + \u2192 (aoe) Room 11 (Defeat 2 Lava Strykewyrms) \u2b25 Bladed Dive down the steps after the barrier opens, then Surge toward the 2 Lava Strykewyrms near the barrier on the far end of the room. \u2b25 Greater Barge onto one, bleed Assault \u2b25 Finish them off with aoes. \u2192 \u2192 (tc) + (if necessary) + \u2192 Section 2 Section 2 is significantly more relaxed compared to the previous section; however, it can also be more difficult to stack up and aoe the Black dragons compared to the much smaller and closely packed Slimes, Golems, and Celestials of the previous areas. Focus heavily on damage output, smart usage of long cooldowns, and efficient movement and lures. Verak Lith is also a comparatively much more simple boss than Astellarn. Room 1 (Defeat 4 Black Dragons) \u2b25 After the two Strykewyrms, use a dose of Powerburst of Acceleration and Surge + Bladed Dive around the corner to the first black dragon. \u2b25 Use your bleeds, on-task Tuska's Wrath if it is available, then Surge + Bladed Dive toward the barrier to lure the other three black dragons together. \u2b25 Use ZGS special attack or Meteor Strike and finish them off with aoes and thresholds. + + \u2192 (first dragon) (walked) \u2192 \u2192 (on-task) \u2192 + (to barrier) (remaining dragons) / \u2192 (aoe) Room 2 (Defeat 6 Black Dragons) \u2b25 Surge through the barrier as it opens and use bleeds against the first black dragon. \u2b25 Build to Berserk and use aoes to kill as many black dragons as possible before it runs out. \u2b25 Finish any remaining black dragons with bleeds and thresholds.

Familiars can still damage Verak Lith while the spire is alive. \u2b25 Egg Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Verak Lith hits everyone in the room with a moderate damage magic attack that bounces from the player and places a marker on the ground. The intended way to deal with this mechanic is to catch the bomb as it lands on the marker, take note of the element of the bomb (Shock, Ice, or Poison), and match it with one of the opposing clusters of eggs in the boss room. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the bomb is not caught by the player, it will deal 4000 soft-typeless aoe damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If not matched to an opposing egg, the energy will discharge, dealing 9000 soft-typeless damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As the first part of this special attack is soft-typeless , the optimal way to deal with this mechanic is to simply tank it using Disruption Shield , Resonance , or a Powerburst of Vitality . \u2b25 Divebomb - Verak Lith calls down a dragon that will deal severe magic damage in a line, similar to Vindicta's fire attack, after a short delay. It is best dealt with by simply moving out of the way. \u2b25 Tornados - Verak Lith places a cluster of flaming tornados on the players location. After activating, they deal rapid, severe magic damage if not avoided. Run far away to ensure you are not stacked out. Seeing this special attack can be indicative of a slow kill. Strategy \u2b25 Though straightforward, the Verak Lith fight can be punishing to players with low damage output. Spires must be dispatched quickly to ensure enough time to damage the boss before the next Spire spawns, and each additional Spire will slow the encounter down significantly. Therefore, the aim, like many bosses, is to output as much damage as possible, using as many boosts as are available to the player, while dealing with mechanics as they come. If followed well, this rotation will result in consistent 1:20 to 1:30 kills or better. At this speed, Verak Lith's tornado attack will be completely skipped. \u2b25 Verak Lith deals moderate to high damage, using only melee attacks in melee distance, and only magic attacks outside of melee distance. Rotations + \u2192 (2 ticks) \u2192 \u2192 (tc) + (dw) + \u2192 (4taa) + \u2192 \u2192 (t92) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Spire (tc) + \u2192 (basics) \u2192 (walked) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + (2h auto) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Spire (tc) + \u2192 (basics) / \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Note: If the fight is not over at this point, kill the spire with + basics and finish Verak Lith off with bleeds and basics. Save for the next barrier. Section 3 Section 3 is much like Section 2 in that the enemies will have a difficult time stacking out your life points (though they can still do a lot of damage if you aren't careful), but it can also be easier to get better lures on the Gemstones compared to the previous Black Dragons. Be very aware of Hydrix dragon special attacks as getting hit by one may force you out of the dungeon due to its high damage and adrenaline drain. Room 1 (Defeat 3 Dragonstone dragons and 1 Onyx dragon) \u2b25 Move back out of the boss room, toward the bank chest and teleport to option 4: 'Kalist Kiket Fia'.

Upon impact it deals high melee damage, drains adrenaline to 0%, and temporarily halves adrenaline gain. \u2b25 Dragonbreath - A moderate damage magic attack with extremely high accuracy. Note: this does not do \"dragonfire\"-type damage. \u2b25 Smoke Spiral - The Black Stone Dragon will root itself in place while a smoke cloud that deals severe typeless damage spirals around it. No matter where it starts, the spiral will never hit a player standing directly behind Black Stone Dragon's tail. It is possible to flank the boss by standing in position while this special attack is occurring. \u2b25 Mage AoE - Similar to Verak Lith's tornados, Black Stone Dragon sends several smoke clouds out to somewhere in the boss room. Standing in this area will result in rapid, severe magic damage. Strategy \u2b25 The Black Stone Dragon is the final encounter in the Dragonkin Laboratory. Though her attack speed is relatively slow, she can utilize high-damage magic , ranged , and melee auto attacks, and has very strong area denial mechanics. \u2b25 After being damaged to 520k life points, during the time of her next attack she will become immune to damage and four level 122 Black Hands with 80k life points will spawn at the shackles surrounding her. These Black Hands will periodically slap at the ground and fire off high damage magic attack. After this attack lands, a line of shadow hands will spawn out of the hand in a line toward where the tile the attack landed in. These shadow hands deal very rapid, severe typeless damage. Optimally, the best way to deal with this attack is to allow the magic attack to hit you, move to another side of the hand one tick later, and continue attacking. These enemies are susceptable to the Terrasaur maul and Dominion mines . \u2b25 In addition to this magic attack, black hands also have a low damage melee attack that may, under currently unknown circumstances, target familiars for inconsequential damage. \u2b25 After the four Black Hands have been destroyed, retarget the Black Stone Dragon and continue the rotation until 260k life points, being aware that a smoke spiral special attack will quickly follow the Black Hands phase. Following this, she will jump into the air, land in another place in the boss room and fire out a slow moving, rapid typeless damage line of smoke. After landing 7 times, the fight will continue until the boss is dead.

This is applied following her first auto attack after she is damaged under 200k life points. \u2b25 Pulsar - Astellarn spawns small orange orb with 20k life points that periodically deals moderate \"cannon-type\" damage and is successible to \u200e \u200eDominion mines . It is highly recommended to kill this soon after it spawns. \u2b25 Celestial Rain - Upon reaching 200k life points, Astellarn will targets a quadrant of the boss room with a low-damaging typeless-damage aoe effect that ramps up if stood in for too long. \u2b25 Wyrmhole - Astellarn will mark a player with a blue bar. When the bar empties it will drop a black circle on the floor that deals moderate typeless damage when stood in. \u2b25 Neutron Star - A small black orb with an orange trail that will explode, dealing severe typeless damage to the player that came in contact with it. Must be lured into the wyrmhole to progress the boss fight. \u2b25 White Hole - Once the Neutron star is lured into the Wyrmhole, the aoe will turn white. When a player stands on top of it, Astellarn's damage reduction will be removed, and the player's damage output will be boosted even further. Note: Due to the way the attack timing is determined, it is possible for the wyrmhole and neutron star to desynchonize. Be aware that it is possible, but very rare, for the neutron star to spawn before the wyrmhole is placed. Strategy \u2b25 Astellarn can be a very punishing and complex boss \u200e \u200efor beginners, especially when using melee, but once the mechanics are understood and handled properly she becomes a very consistent encounter. \u2b25 Unlike most bosses, Astellarn's boss fight timer does not start until she is attacked. Keeping this in mind, it is still important to start the boss fight as soon as possible, both for overall dungeon clear time, and because it is possible for slimes from previous rooms to follow you into the boss room if they are not blocked by a celestial dragon, stopped by sticky bombs before the boss room, or stopped by the barrier that closes once the boss fight begins. \u2b25 The beginning of the fight is straightforward. Referring to the image, it is highly recommended to only stand in the area highlighted by green. Due to a quirk in Astellarn's auto attack AI, she will only attack with magic autos while you are standing in the green area, while standing anywhere else will allow her to use all of magic , ranged , and \u200e \u200emelee autos. Standing in this area significantly reduces her damage output on you, and makes soul split flicking her attacks much easier. \u2b25 The goal of the first part of the boss fight is to damage Astellarn to under 200k life points (upon which she will gain massive damage reduction) before she spawns her first pulsar. Regardless of her life points, when the pulsar spawns, use dismember on it, drop your dominion mines, and finish it off with basics. Generally by the time this is accomplished, Astellarn will have already marked you with a secondary bar under your adrenaline that counts down until an aoe damaging \"Wyrmhole\" is placed underneath you. \u2b25 Ideally, this wyrmhole is placed in melee distance, on one of the axes denoted in the image by red, perpendicular lines. The best placement location for this special attack on the axis marked by a red \"X\" on the image. This placement ensures that the next mechanic, the Neutron star, will not spawn on top of you, ruining the kill. \u2b25 Once the wyrmhole is placed, build adrenaline for berserk and lure the slow moving Neutron star toward the wyrmhole. Once the Neutron star moves into the Wyrmhole, the aoe on the ground will turn white and boost the damage you deal while you stand on top of it. Following this, use Berserk + Adrenaline renewal \u2192 , and finish your Berserk rotation.

It is best dealt with by simply moving out of the way. \u2b25 Tornados - Verak Lith places a cluster of flaming tornados on the players location. After activating, they deal rapid, severe magic damage if not avoided. Run far away to ensure you are not stacked out. Seeing this special attack can be indicative of a slow kill. Strategy \u2b25 Though straightforward, the Verak Lith fight can be punishing to players with low damage output. Spires must be dispatched quickly to ensure enough time to damage the boss before the next Spire spawns, and each additional Spire will slow the encounter down significantly. Therefore, the aim, like many bosses, is to output as much damage as possible, using as many boosts as are available to the player, while dealing with mechanics as they come. If followed well, this rotation will result in consistent 1:20 to 1:30 kills or better. At this speed, Verak Lith's tornado attack will be completely skipped. \u2b25 Verak Lith deals moderate to high damage, using only melee attacks in melee distance, and only magic attacks outside of melee distance.

Note: this does not do \"dragonfire\"-type damage. \u2b25 Smoke Spiral - The Black Stone Dragon will root itself in place while a smoke cloud that deals severe typeless damage spirals around it. No matter where it starts, the spiral will never hit a player standing directly behind Black Stone Dragon's tail. It is possible to flank the boss by standing in position while this special attack is occurring. \u2b25 Mage AoE - Similar to Verak Lith's tornados, Black Stone Dragon sends several smoke clouds out to somewhere in the boss room. Standing in this area will result in rapid, severe magic damage. Strategy \u2b25 The Black Stone Dragon is the final encounter in the Dragonkin Laboratory. Though her attack speed is relatively slow, she can utilize high-damage magic , ranged , and melee auto attacks, and has very strong area denial mechanics. \u2b25 After being damaged to 520k life points, during the time of her next attack she will become immune to damage and four level 122 Black Hands with 80k life points will spawn at the shackles surrounding her. These Black Hands will periodically slap at the ground and fire off high damage magic attack. After this attack lands, a line of shadow hands will spawn out of the hand in a line toward where the tile the attack landed in. These shadow hands deal very rapid, severe typeless damage. Optimally, the best way to deal with this attack is to allow the magic attack to hit you, move to another side of the hand one tick later, and continue attacking. These enemies are susceptable to the Terrasaur maul and Dominion mines . \u2b25 In addition to this magic attack, black hands also have a low damage melee attack that may, under currently unknown circumstances, target familiars for inconsequential damage. \u2b25 After the four Black Hands have been destroyed, retarget the Black Stone Dragon and continue the rotation until 260k life points, being aware that a smoke spiral special attack will quickly follow the Black Hands phase.

Room 3 \u2b25 Run to this spot along the east wall just past the middle pillar to stack the magma golems to use Mechanised Chinchompas . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Only 4 golems must be killed to open the barrier so Snap Shot and Rapid Fire should do the trick.

Room 5 \u2b25 Surge and run up against the West wall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Deaths Swiftness here against the wall and Chin down the Celestials. \u2b25 Diagonally Surge down the steps and tag the closer Celestial. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run up against the east wall to use the remaining Deaths Swiftness timer to kill this Celestial to open the barrier. \u2b25 Run down the steps and use Rapid Fire and basics to kill 1 of the Celestials. Room 6 Stack the 2 nearest celestials and Chin them down to open the barrier. Note: Room 6 actually occurs after Astellarn. Astellarn, the First Celestial The first encounter of the Laboratory, This fight heavily utilizes punishing area-of-effect mechanics but is still very straightforward and easy to master with some practice. Additionally, he drops the Greater Flurry Codex . Mechanics \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Pulsar: Spawned after 2-3 autoattacks, it has 20,000 hp, dealing moderate periodic damage. Shortly after, a bar will appear above the player's head and a Wyrmhole will spawn at their current location when it fills. This special attack is cast based upon the time you entered the dungeon, potentially de-syncing with the Neutron Star. Placing the wyrmhole along these lines will prevent it from being blocked out by the later rain mechanic. Pulsar pulsing its firey waves \u2b25 Neutron Star: This will follow the player around and must be lured into the Wyrmhole, stabilizing it, turning white, and giving increased damage to Astellarn. This special attack is cast based upon the time you started the fight with Astellarn, potentially de-syncing with the Wyrmhole. If it touches a player, it will explode, dealing 5000 damage. Its highly recommended to teleport out and restart the fight if this happens. \u2b25 Celestial Rain: Once the boss reaches 200,000 HP, Asterllarn will take decreased damage and spawn a continuous rain in a random quadrant that deals increasing damage as long as it is stood in. This will change quadrants occasionally and will only be a major issue if the Wyrmhole was placed improperly. From here on, these mechanics repeat with the rain lasting for the remainder of the encounter. Strategy \u2b25 Do not use to start the fight. Astellarn will heavily cap damage starting at 200,000 HP. Your goal is to use a few thresholds before pre-phasing with an as close to 200K as possible. \u2b25 Build to on the pulsar with basics and place the Wyrmhole in melee distance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After placing, run straight back to the wall along the quadrant line and build on Astellarn while waiting for the Neutron Star to spawn. \u2b25 Lure the Neutron Star to your Wyrmhole and use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise. Section 2 Note: Dragons are numbered in the order you encounter them. Room 1 Surge + Bladed Dive to the nearest pair of lava strykewyrms and Chin them down with Rapid Fire . Room 2 \u2b25 Use an Acceleration Powerburst after the barrier to quickly reach Room 2. \u2b25 Go all the way to melee distance of the 3rd Dragon and use a Mechanised Chinchompa Seren Godbow EoF Spec before running back west to drag Dragons 3 and 4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Doing this should in turn drag Dragons 1 and 2 east setting both pairs up to be chinned. \u2b25 Finish them off with thresholds but try to exit Room 2 with high adrenaline. Room 3 \u2b25 Run past the 1st 3 Dragons then around to the south side of the 4th Dragon and use Deaths Swiftness . \u200e \u200eTarget Dragon 2 and step back up against the black rocks to drag it south. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This should also draw dragons 5 and 6 closer. \u2b25 Use a Mechanised Chinchompa Seren Godbow EoF Spec on Dragon 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Proceed to target Dragon 4 again and kill it. \u2b25 Use a Mechanised Chinchompa Dark Bow EoF Spec on Dragon 1 and kill it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Then turn around and Chin Dragons 5 and 6. \u2b25 Finish off the remaining dragons to open the barrier. Room 4 \u2b25 Eldritch Crossbow Spec and kill the 4 Lava Strykewyrms nearest to the barrier with thresholds. Room 5 \u2b25 Target the farthest north dragon and step back to drag it and the middle dragon west before using a Mechanised Chinchompa Seren Godbow EoF Spec on the middle dragon. \u2b25 Finish off these 3 dragons and the 1 by the barrier with basics and thresholds. \u200e \u200eBe careful to exit with 100% adren for Verak Lith. Verak Lith The second encounter of the Laboratory, his attack rotation is very predictable but deals consistent moderately high damage so it is recommended to learn the few mechanics properly to avoid any unnecessary deaths. Additionally he drops the Greater Fury Codex . It will always melee auto attack when the player is in melee distance and always mage otherwise. The auto attacks hit quite hard and specifically the mage ones are desynced visually so it is important to not mess up too many prayer flicks here. Verak Lith's Attack Rotation 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Spire \u2192 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Ricochet \u2192 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Spire \u2192 4 Auto Attacks \u2192 Nosedive/Hurricanes \u2192 Repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Spire : The message \"Verak Lith slams his tail against the ground, the earth shakes beneath your feet!\" will appear and after a short delay and spire with 15,000 hp will spawn near the player. The boss will be immune to damage while the spire is alive so it is good to threshold to get it down immediately. The spawn will also be accompanied by a moderate melee hit that can be Resonanced . In a typical kill, this will be the primary method alongside Soul Split flicking to restore HP. \u2b25 Ricochet : Verak Lith will send out a projectile that lands at a spot around the player after a few seconds. The element of this projectile can be poison, ice, or shock, and corresponds with the three groups of eggs found around the arena. The correct way to deal with this mechanic is to pick up the projectile and interact with a different type of egg to disperse it before the bar fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Missing the projectile will deal 4000 damage and missing the dispersal can deal 9000+ damage so it is especially important not to miss the second half of this mechanic. Generally, if the projectile matches the element of the nearest group of eggs to the player, it should be ignored with Disruption Shield , Debilitate , or Reflect (or nothing if the player is high HP). This will end the mechanic early. A player picks up the projectile \u2b25 Nosedive : A message will appear on the screen mentioning that a dragon is nosediving. An arrow will show up near the player to indicate the direction the dragon is approaching from and, after a short delay, a thin line of dragonbreath will be fired along the line the arrow is pointing. This can deal over 8000 magic damage and can be avoided by simply moving out of the way. However, the arrow will adjust it's position based on the player's movement for a short period so it is recommended to learn the timing on this mechanic and move as it goes off. \u2b25 Hurricanes : Verak Lith will say \"Let the flames melt the flesh from your bones\" and engulf the area around the player in fire. This will deal no damage but after a short delay, hurricanes will spawn in the area that deal extremely high damage and last for roughly 20 seconds. This is a fairly large area attack and should be surged from to be a safe distance away. It isn't very complicated however, simply don't touch a hurricane. Projectile is fired Hurricanes unleashed Strategy \u2b25 Start out the fight with and try to get in \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 before the first spire but be wary as sgb specing too late will get it nulled. \u2b25 Kill the Spire basics then end your with \u2192 \u2192 . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Disrupt the Ricochet rather than going to it and try to get in a before the 2nd spire while building. \u2b25 Kill the 2nd Spire with basics then right away. \u2b25 Dodge the Nosedive while doing \u2192 \u2192 and improvise from there with possibly a if Verak's HP is low. Section 3 Room 1 \u2b25 Surge + Bladed Dive and run past the Onyx Dragons as they don't need to be killed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tag the 1st Dragonstone Dragon with Fragmentation Shot and run back towards the pole to lure the dragons together. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A Mechanised Chinchompa Seren Godbow EoF Spec and a Mechanised Chinchompa Dark Bow EoF Spec should be used here to clear the stacked dragons. Room 2 \u2b25 Surge + Bladed Dive up the stairs and target the dragonstone closest to the barrier for another Mechanised Chinchompa Seren Godbow EoF Spec . A Snap Shot and some basics should be adequate to finish them off. Room 3 \u2b25 Drink your Acceleration Powerburst to Surge + Bladed Dive past the hydrix dragons to reach to 2 dragonstones at the barrier. (Note: you can cut every corner here) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Kill the dragonstones with thresh and an Seren Godbow EoF Spec . Room 4 \u2b25 Surge and tag the farthest north Dragonstone. \u2b25 Use Fragmentation Shot then run back to where the wall juts out to lure them together to Chin them down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Try to end on full adren for the Black Stone Dragon. Black Stone Dragon The Black Stone Dragon is the final boss encounter in the Dragonkin Laboratory and is the main source of the dungeon's primary unique: Draconic Energies , which are used to make the Mage T92 Elite Tectonic set . Alongside dropping the Greater Barge Codex , which sees frequent use in endgame melee encounters. This fight consists of fairly simple mechanics but can be very punishing if mistakes are made. It is also one of the few bosses to auto attack in all three combat styles, with melee hitting especially hard, so it is possible to die just from auto attacks if the player can't outheal with soul split, is low on food, and/or can't prayer flick the fight. Attack Rotation \u2b25 Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 3 Auto Attacks \u2192 Gemstone Spikes \u2192 2 Auto Attacks \u2192 Dragonbreath \u2192 Repeat \u2b25 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Black Hands \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1-5 Auto Attacks \u2192 Smoke Spiral \u2192 3 Auto Attacks \u2192 Mage AoE \u2192 2 Auto Attacks \u2192 Dragonbreath \u2192 Gemstone Spikes \u2192 3 Auto Attacks \u2192 Mage AoE \u2192 Repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Gemstone Spikes : This mechanic occurs a few auto attacks into the start of the fight and after each dragonbreath after phase 1. This is identical to the hydrix dragon special attack where a line of spikes are shot through the ground and erupt under the player. This deals 5000+ melee damage and drains all adrenaline upon impact. It will also apply a debuff that reduces all adrenaline gain by 50% for a short duration. Simply move out of the way when this comes out. \u2b25 Dragonbreath : The skybox will turn dark blue and Black Stone Dragon will fire a 100% accuracy mage attack that deals moderate damage. This is essentially just a mage auto attack that hits slightly harder but signals that the spikes are coming out immediately after (phase 3). \u2b25 Black Hands (Phase 2): Phase 2 will begin as Black Stone Dragon's first attack after reaching 520k HP. This is signaled by Black Stone Dragon moving to the center of the arena and 4 black hands with 80,000 hp each spawning where the rocks are located. These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal rapid 2000+ damage if stood on. These hands will never reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured below. The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1. \u2b25 Smoke Spiral : A line of smoke will spiral inwards towards Black Stone Dragon, dealing 4000+ damage per tick if stood on. The boss will remain stationary during this time so Flanking is possible here. It is recommended to learn where you can stand safely to avoid having to cancel channeled abilities. Generally, a max range Death Swiftness to the sides of the boss will provide decent freedom of movement and allow for Flanking \u2b25 Mage AoE : Black Stone Dragon will call out \"GET. OUT. OF. ME.\" or \"The shadow overwhelms!\" and turn to fire a black projectile towards a random spot in the arena. This is very similar to Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will explode into black tendrils that deal 4000+ damage in the area for a short period. In a solo encounter, this will miss most of the time and isn't a big concern. The boss can also be flanked when it turns to send out the special. \u2b25 Fly : Upon hitting 260,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon will become invulnerable and fly around the arena, landing at various spots and sending out smoke lines towards the player each time. Additional lines will also spawn out of existing ones on each land, so movement can get hectic if the boss lands at the same area multiple times. This smoke is functionally identical to the type in the spiral mechanic and should be avoided at all costs. This will occur 7 times before the boss becomes vulnerable again and continues the phase 3 rotation starting from Smoke Spiral. The lines will not spawn if the boss lands out of range but it is still highly recommended to follow and use an ability after each landing as the boss will take longer to fly again if the player stays far away. Strategy \u2b25 Start out the fight with and use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise to phase the boss. \u2b25 Spam to kill the Black Hands. \u2b25 right away on BSD and use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 or (if hp is close to or below 250,000). \u2b25 BSD will enter the flying phase where it is near immune to damage; however, Soul Split will still heal you as if full damage was dealt during this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Count the jumps and activate when BSD jumps for the 6th time and build to . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise to finish it off.

Additionally he drops the Greater Fury Codex . It will always melee auto attack when the player is in melee distance and always mage otherwise. The auto attacks hit quite hard and specifically the mage ones are desynced visually so it is important to not mess up too many prayer flicks here. Verak Lith's Attack Rotation 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Spire \u2192 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Ricochet \u2192 4 Auto attacks \u2192 Spire \u2192 4 Auto Attacks \u2192 Nosedive/Hurricanes \u2192 Repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Spire : The message \"Verak Lith slams his tail against the ground, the earth shakes beneath your feet!\" will appear and after a short delay and spire with 15,000 hp will spawn near the player. The boss will be immune to damage while the spire is alive so it is good to threshold to get it down immediately. The spawn will also be accompanied by a moderate melee hit that can be Resonanced . In a typical kill, this will be the primary method alongside Soul Split flicking to restore HP. \u2b25 Ricochet : Verak Lith will send out a projectile that lands at a spot around the player after a few seconds. The element of this projectile can be poison, ice, or shock, and corresponds with the three groups of eggs found around the arena. The correct way to deal with this mechanic is to pick up the projectile and interact with a different type of egg to disperse it before the bar fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Missing the projectile will deal 4000 damage and missing the dispersal can deal 9000+ damage so it is especially important not to miss the second half of this mechanic. Generally, if the projectile matches the element of the nearest group of eggs to the player, it should be ignored with Disruption Shield , Debilitate , or Reflect (or nothing if the player is high HP). This will end the mechanic early. A player picks up the projectile \u2b25 Nosedive : A message will appear on the screen mentioning that a dragon is nosediving. An arrow will show up near the player to indicate the direction the dragon is approaching from and, after a short delay, a thin line of dragonbreath will be fired along the line the arrow is pointing. This can deal over 8000 magic damage and can be avoided by simply moving out of the way. However, the arrow will adjust it's position based on the player's movement for a short period so it is recommended to learn the timing on this mechanic and move as it goes off. \u2b25 Hurricanes : Verak Lith will say \"Let the flames melt the flesh from your bones\" and engulf the area around the player in fire. This will deal no damage but after a short delay, hurricanes will spawn in the area that deal extremely high damage and last for roughly 20 seconds. This is a fairly large area attack and should be surged from to be a safe distance away. It isn't very complicated however, simply don't touch a hurricane.

Alongside dropping the Greater Barge Codex , which sees frequent use in endgame melee encounters. This fight consists of fairly simple mechanics but can be very punishing if mistakes are made. It is also one of the few bosses to auto attack in all three combat styles, with melee hitting especially hard, so it is possible to die just from auto attacks if the player can't outheal with soul split, is low on food, and/or can't prayer flick the fight.

This is identical to the hydrix dragon special attack where a line of spikes are shot through the ground and erupt under the player. This deals 5000+ melee damage and drains all adrenaline upon impact. It will also apply a debuff that reduces all adrenaline gain by 50% for a short duration. Simply move out of the way when this comes out. \u2b25 Dragonbreath : The skybox will turn dark blue and Black Stone Dragon will fire a 100% accuracy mage attack that deals moderate damage. This is essentially just a mage auto attack that hits slightly harder but signals that the spikes are coming out immediately after (phase 3). \u2b25 Black Hands (Phase 2): Phase 2 will begin as Black Stone Dragon's first attack after reaching 520k HP. This is signaled by Black Stone Dragon moving to the center of the arena and 4 black hands with 80,000 hp each spawning where the rocks are located. These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal rapid 2000+ damage if stood on. These hands will never reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured below. The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1. \u2b25 Smoke Spiral : A line of smoke will spiral inwards towards Black Stone Dragon, dealing 4000+ damage per tick if stood on. The boss will remain stationary during this time so Flanking is possible here. It is recommended to learn where you can stand safely to avoid having to cancel channeled abilities. Generally, a max range Death Swiftness to the sides of the boss will provide decent freedom of movement and allow for Flanking \u2b25 Mage AoE : Black Stone Dragon will call out \"GET. OUT. OF. ME.\" or \"The shadow overwhelms!\" and turn to fire a black projectile towards a random spot in the arena. This is very similar to Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will explode into black tendrils that deal 4000+ damage in the area for a short period. In a solo encounter, this will miss most of the time and isn't a big concern. The boss can also be flanked when it turns to send out the special. \u2b25 Fly : Upon hitting 260,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon will become invulnerable and fly around the arena, landing at various spots and sending out smoke lines towards the player each time. Additional lines will also spawn out of existing ones on each land, so movement can get hectic if the boss lands at the same area multiple times. This smoke is functionally identical to the type in the spiral mechanic and should be avoided at all costs. This will occur 7 times before the boss becomes vulnerable again and continues the phase 3 rotation starting from Smoke Spiral. The lines will not spawn if the boss lands out of range but it is still highly recommended to follow and use an ability after each landing as the boss will take longer to fly again if the player stays far away.

The Temple of Aminishi is located on the island of Aminishi and requires completion of Impressing the Locals to access, additionally, the grouping system is required in order to form a team of 2-3 players. Each solo run of ED1 is worth 12,944,100 in Ancient Scales. Advanced players can get up to 4 kph, earning on average 51,776,400 gp/hr General Notes \u2b25 This guide is structured in the order that rooms would be encountered if running the dungeon. Rotations are written to utilize the Greater Chain ability and assume 4TAA is used; however, neither is required to effectively do this dungeon. \u2b25 It's also assumed that you have completed City of Senntisten quest and that you will be using Incite Fear as your auto cast spell. \u2b25 Magic ED1 is a learner friendly option out of the three styles. The gear required for optimal strategies is relatively cheap compared to the other styles. \u2b25 Feel free to adjust the boss rotations to better suit your skill level with switches and 4TAA. \u2b25 The boss rotations assume you have Invigorating 4 perk \u2b25 It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double surge to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia. \u2b25 You can Surge or Bladed dive a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry.

This method however loses about 20 seconds. Sanctum Guardian The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared. Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. There are two options for approaching this boss fight. A learner friendly strategy has you teleport out of the dungeon before entering the fight and attacking the boss from north side of the arena. A more advanced strategy involves luring Arhats behind the boss making them not attack you.

Note: The autoattack that comes after the Purple Smoke can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Deflect Melee for this part and switch to Deflect Missiles during the attacks travel time if necessary. \u2b25 Ranged Autoattacks - A projectile that target the spot the player is standing on and hits everyone in a 3x3 area centred around that spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As it is targetted to a tile rather than the player and has a travel time before it hits, it is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough before the attack lands though this is normally not necessary. \u2b25 Water Burst - A high-hitting melee attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deflect Melee should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is also possible to avoid this attack completely by standing at the back of the arena so it won't reach you or using Resonance if you need the extra healing. \u2b25 Water Jet - A beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Should you get hit by this mechanic, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This attack can be dealt with in several ways by blocking with Disruption Shield /Resonance or simply face-tanking the damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Standing at the north of the arena allows you to dodge the attack entirely by standing east when it starts and moving west. Note: During this mechanic, the boss will face north and stop using autoattacks, you will be able to use Flanking if you're standing south and pray Soul Split here. \u2b25 Purple Smoke - The most dangerous attack of the boss \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A blue bar will appear above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After a moment, this Smoke cloud will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Purple Smoke should be placed in a manner that it will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The placement of the Smokes will depend on which side of the arena you are standing on. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If using the south spot, you can place the first smoke on the south wall and the second one directly north of it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you are doing the learner friendly north spot you can place the first smoke directly north of the boss and then stack them to north-east of the arena Strategy \u2b25 The following rotation assumes that you are using the south spot for flanking and vulnerability bombs. \u2b25 It's recommended to improvise when possible especially focusing on more if lucky with Impatient /Relentless procs \u2b25 Smoke cloud \u2192 on south edge of Sanctum's \"pool\" \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 the Water Jet attack\u2192 \u2192 (3t) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise with / until comes off cd \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise until dead Note: The auto attacks after using metamorphosis are ice spells because only they will get boosted by metamorphosis if your auto-cast is an ice spell 3rd Floor Room 1 \u2b25Ignore all other mobs and navigate your way to the bridge that has two cloaked zealots.

Masuta, the Ascended Masuta, the second boss of the dungeon, keeps true to the dungeon's theme of heavy damage dealt and high KO potential. Using a variety of hard-hitting mechanics and boasting attacks from all three combat styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty spike up from the first boss. Drops \u2b25 Onyx Dust \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Common drop, 1-29 dropped per kill \u2b25 Masuta's Warspear \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Rare drop Phase 1 \u2b25 Attack Rotation Autoattacks \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Autoattacks \u2192 \u2192 repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Autoattacks - Mostly Melee-based although he can also uncommonly use Ranged instead. The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. His ranged auto-attacks A clone melee auto-attack Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. \u2b25 Hurricane - Masuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note: It\u2019s possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u2b25 Tsunami - After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using as the autoattack before the hits. Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield unlocked, it is possible to Resonance and flick Deflect Mage . This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami Reso prayer flick demonstration - https://youtu.be/WZlGkkmUsis Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it. timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0 Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. \u2b25 Pulverise - After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight Phase \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. \u2b25 Shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic . for the duration of this special attack. \u2b25 When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2. Notes: You can use a lossless here to reduce damage taken. You must be near 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2 Starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. \u2b25 The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used. Strategy \u2b25 Phase 1 Notes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to the rng nature of Masuta's attack pattern, this fight heavily involves improvising rotations especially when paired up with crit buff procs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It's recommended to kite Masuta during p1 until his Hurricane attack ends and then start rotation \u2b25 Phase 1 Rotation \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise and kite until Hurricane ends \u2192 + \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Improvise until phased Notes: Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channelled abilities. You may have to use or abandon your if Masuta does an early 2nd Hurricane. \u2b25 Flight Phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start the phase with your Enhanced Excalibur , the waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise and when moving from water to water. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make sure to stand near the waters when they die to make the next phase safer. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should apply and on Masuta just before the phase ends. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly recommended (though not strictly necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts. \u2b25 Final Phase \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise until dead Notes: Save limitless for Seiryu. Make sure to move closer to Masuta when using since it has a short range. 5th Floor Defence Pylons \u2b25 There are only three defense pylons that you need to kill to open the final barrier. Ignore the first 4 pylons and + to the middle platform. \u2b25 You should kill the three pylons which are opposite of the bank chest. the middle one and \u2192 another one. Finish with / . \u2b25 The pylons can hit surprisingly high so you should pray mage and use a lossless before targeting them. \u2b25 It's important to have 91+ adrenaline when entering the upcoming boss fight so don't use on the pylons. \u2b25 Try to eat some food before withdrawing preset so you don't enter the boss fight at very low health \u2b25 + down the bridge to enter the final boss arena. Seiryu, the Azure Serpent To finish the dungeon, you need to free Seiryu by destroying the three black crystals on his shackles. This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics.

Mechanics \u2b25 Overview \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. \u2b25 Attack Rotations Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Huge Breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow Energy \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. \u2b25 Tail Blackholes - Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it. \u2b25 Huge Breath - When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield / Resonance or use Vengeance and tank it. \u2b25 Shadow Energy - When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path. \u2b25 Black Hands - Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent. \u2b25 Crystal Phase - Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu.

You can simply use ice wrack and thresholds to kill it easily. Using is also an option if necessary. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Doing proper damage to the middle crystal on the 1st cycle is the key to being able to get a 2 cycle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It can't be stressed enough: Do not jump down to deal with the blobs in any circumstance. \u2b25 Middle Crystal Rotation Make sure the middle crystal has and \u2192 (dw) + dominion mines on the 4th heal \u2192 \u2192 Cancel with after you HP goes below 4k.

Finish it off with + + \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you fail to finish off the crystals you will have to do a third cycle.

Note: During this mechanic, the boss will face north and stop using autoattacks, you will be able to use Flanking if you're standing south and pray Soul Split here. \u2b25 Purple Smoke - The most dangerous attack of the boss \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A blue bar will appear above your character which drains.

The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. His ranged auto-attacks A clone melee auto-attack Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. \u2b25 Hurricane - Masuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note: It\u2019s possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u2b25 Tsunami - After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using as the autoattack before the hits. Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield unlocked, it is possible to Resonance and flick Deflect Mage . This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami Reso prayer flick demonstration - https://youtu.be/WZlGkkmUsis Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it. timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0 Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. \u2b25 Pulverise - After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight Phase \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. \u2b25 Shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic . for the duration of this special attack. \u2b25 When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2. Notes: You can use a lossless here to reduce damage taken. You must be near 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2 Starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. \u2b25 The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance.

Mechanics \u2b25 Overview \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. \u2b25 Attack Rotations Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Huge Breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow Energy \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. \u2b25 Tail Blackholes - Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it. \u2b25 Huge Breath - When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield / Resonance or use Vengeance and tank it. \u2b25 Shadow Energy - When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path. \u2b25 Black Hands - Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent. \u2b25 Crystal Phase - Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu.

Once learned and mastered, running this dungeon will provide a consistent source of GP, making it an immensely rewarding experience. Things to Know \u2b25 Bladed Dive , Mobile Perk , and having Double Surge unlocked are essential for maximising speed. \u2b25 There are two NPCs with strong special attacks, Hanto Sellwords and Death Lotus Rogues. Dealing correctly with them is important to minimise risk. \u2b25 Keep track of the HP of all the important(barrier-unlocking) NPCs. \u2b25 As quite a number of mobs in this dungeon will stun you, incorporating Freedom into your rotations is strongly advised. \u2b25 The Corbicula Rex perk (112 Farming) in ROoT is extremely helpful in this dungeon, as Meteor Strike is frequently used here.

Room 1 \u2b25 Surge with your Mobile Switch equipped, then run down the stairs and Bladed Dive towards the tile at the centre. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the Bladed Dive click diagonally and Surge into a Noxious Scythe Greater Barge targetting one specific Elite Sotapanna (shown below), follow up with an Assault (bled) on the one south of your position, Cleave the Sotapanna you barged and Hurricane \u2192 Quake the other 2 enemies. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Save Meteor Strike for later.

Room 3 \u2b25 Go east, Greater Barge the northern Elite Sakadagami, bleed an Assault (dw) on it and drop 2 of your Dominion Mines . \u2b25 Freedom and equip your Noxious Scythe while positioning yourself right in front of the middle Sakadagami and Cleave \u2192 Hurricane targetting the southern one. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dominion Mines should explode on the middle enemy, if it does not kill him, finish him with one strong basic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You will probably finish this room with 100% adrenaline due to the Meteor Strike you used earlier. Section 2 Room 1 \u2b25 Anticipation and Berserk while getting into Greater Barge range. With your Noxious Scythe equipped, Greater Barge the Elite Sotapanna (standing in the centre) and Sever him. \u2b25 Position yourself one tile southeast of him (marked as an X below), Cleave the northernmost enemy you can reach, use one more basic (prioritise hitting the healer) and Limitless a Hurricane into the southernmost Sakadagami. \u2b25 Walk to the mirrored version of the spot you currently are and Quake AoE down who is left alive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Remember to position yourself optimally to hit multiple enemies with Cleave . Room 2 \u2b25 Go to the northern side of the room and Noxious Scythe Bladed Dive the Elite Sakadagami on the centre. \u2b25 Meteor Strike should be off cooldown by now, use it if you are close to 100% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hurricane and Quake otherwise. Room 3 \u2b25 Sip you Acceleration Powerburst and Surge Bladed Dive (ignoring the flying Arhats/Anagami) all the way to the southern end of the room. \u2b25 Greater Barge the middle Elite Sakadagami on the right side of the arena.

Note: Avoid using Hurricane here as you will be using Destroy soon. How to Surge Bladed Dive to the lure spot - https://youtu.be/tbhOcg-eQNs Sanctum Guardian The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared. Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. Stand south of the boss, otherwise Arhats/Anagami will aggro you and AoEs will not work ( , , ).

They deal negligible ranged damage and generally should not be seen as the boss should be dead before this point anyway. Note: The autoattack that comes after the Purple Smoke can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Deflect Melee for this part and switch to Deflect Missiles during the attacks travel time if necessary. \u2b25 Ranged Autoattacks - A projectile that target the spot the player is standing on and hits everyone in a 3x3 area centred around that spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As it is targetted to a tile rather than the player and has a travel time before it hits, it is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough before the attack lands though this is normally not necessary. \u2b25 Water Burst - A high-hitting melee attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deflect Melee should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Although slower, it is also possible to avoid this attack completely by moving far away from the boss at the right time, or using Resonance if you need the extra healing. How to avoid the water burst attack - https://youtu.be/3xDLQIAMeEc Note: For experienced players, this is not necessary or worthwhile, as you will be able to heal back any necessary HP with Soul Split flicking. \u2b25 Water Jet - A beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Should you get hit by this mechanic, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This attack can be dealt with in several ways, such as dodging with Bladed Dive or blocking with Disruption Shield /Resonance . How to avoid the water jet with Bladed Dive - https://youtu.be/mlPkDWGGmb8 Note: During this mechanic, the boss will face north and stop using autoattacks, you will be able to use Flanking and pray Soul Split here. \u2b25 Purple Smoke - The most dangerous attack of the boss \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A blue bar will appear above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After a moment, this smoke cloud will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Purple Smoke should be placed in a manner that it will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to use Escape at the correct time to place the Purple Smoke next to the southern wall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing this multiple times, be careful to not Escape into a Purple Smoke you've placed previously. Strategy \u2b25 Start with + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (4hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 . With your \u2192 + or the Water Jet attack. \u2b25 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3hit) \u2192 + to place the smoke \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + the Water Jet and off for . Note: Do not use Assault here as should you use your 2nd Berserk quickly, Assault will not be available when needed. Note: If necessary, stall your ability on your way back to Sanctum after using Escape (on GCD) to place the Purple Smoke. \u2b25 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 (2hit) \u2192 \u2192 . Note: Sanctum should die somewhere around your last Destroy . Adjust the rotation to deal with the Purple Smoke and Water Jet mechanics if necessary. \u2b25 Alternatively, you may use a Fishy Treat after tagging it to completely skip the fight. Section 3 Room 1 \u2b25 Equip your Mobile Switch and Surge Bladed Dive your way to the barrier on the bridge southeast of the room's entrance. \u2b25 Cleave and Quake should be enough to kill the two Cloaked Zealots. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You need to be on 80%+ adrenaline when moving to the next room. Be wary of the patrolling Hanto Sellsword, he can use a deadly special attack. Turn on Deflect Melee if you see a bar over his head. Room 2 \u2b25 Somewhere in the long north-south hallway, there will be three Death Lotus rogues patrolling, they can attack you with a deadly special attack. Block this by using Devotion + Deflect Missiles . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Remember to use Devotion before targetting anything to prevent adrenaline loss. \u2b25 Surge Bladed Dive towards the three Cloaked Zealots and use Noxious Scythe Meteor Strike if you are near 100% adrenaline, Hurricane Quake otherwise. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Summoned Crassian Warriors should die nearly instantly, extending your Devotion . Room 3 \u2b25 Immediatly Surge Bladed Dive down to the base of the circle, there, sip a Acceleration Powerburst and Surge Bladed Dive through the northern half of the circular room until you reach the next barrier. \u2b25 Greater Barge the lone Cloaked Zealot in front of the barrier and finish him off with a bled Assault into Hurricane . Room 4 \u2b25 Surge east then Bladed Dive diagonally across the bridge (as shown below), click towards the three Cloaked Zealots and Surge again. You will land right in front of them. Kill them with Greater Flurry and Cleave . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Finish this part at 100% adrenaline in preparation for the next room. Room 5 \u2b25 Surge your way east, up the stairs. Berserk as soon as you can and build adrenaline with defensives such as Freedom and Anticipation . \u2b25 Next to the door, there will be six Cloaked Zealots, Bladed Dive towards the centre of the line (highlighted below) and do Cleave \u2192 Limitless + Hurricane \u2192 Quake . \u2b25 Finish off any Zealot from the group of six and enter the door. Section 4 Room 1 \u2b25 Greater Barge into the Elite Sakadagami to the west, drop 2 Dominion Mines and use Assault (dw) on him. Freedom and Cleave both. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Finish off with basics if necessary. Room 2 \u2b25 Surge down the stairs to get the attention of the two Eastern mercenaries, then Surge + Bladed Dive northwest to get the attention of the four Renegade Menaphite soldiers. \u2b25 Throw one and with a Noxious Scythe , Meteor Strike as soon as possible, then Hurricane and Quake . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Be wary of the Hanto sellswords in the room. Surge + Bladed Dive demonstration - https://youtu.be/mkdZvnke68o Note: If you are low on food and HP, an slower but safer method of cleaning this room is: After running down half of the stairs, Surge + Bladed Dive in a straight line and stand on the marked square to lure and kill the four Renegade Menaphite soldier. This lets you avoid getting attacked by the Hanto sellswords. Room 3 \u2b25 This room contains two Death Lotus rogues (marked on map: yellow dots), which will not aggro on you when dealt with correctly. Surge + Bladed Dive through the central area of the room as is shown here. Surge + Bladed Dive demonstration - https://youtu.be/iSvwPerRDa4 Note: If you fail to get through without getting the aggro of the two Death Lotus Rogues, turn on Deflect Missiles and eat up. Do not use Devotion here as it will be necessary in Masuta's fight. If this is not done correctly, you will end up taking a lot of unnecessary damage and potentially even dying. \u2b25 After you have successfully Bladed Dive into the west corridor, head up north and Greater Flurry (4 hit) one of the four Cloaked Zealots. Finish clearing the barrier with Quake , Cleave , and Hurricane if necessary. \u2b25 End up on 100% adrenaline. Once the barrier is cleared, Freedom out of any bleeds you may have on you, Surge to the bank chest, and load your preset for Masuta, the Ascended. Masuta, the Ascended Masuta, the second boss of the dungeon, keeps true to the dungeon's theme of heavy damage dealt and high KO potential. Using a variety of hard-hitting mechanics and boasting attacks from all three combat styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty spike up from the first boss. Drops \u2b25 Onyx dust \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Common drop, 1-29 dropped per kill \u2b25 Masuta's warspear \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Rare drop Phase 1 \u2b25 Attack Rotation Autoattacks \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Autoattacks \u2192 Tsunami \u2192 repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Autoattacks: Mostly Melee-based although he can also uncommonly use Ranged instead. The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. His ranged auto-attacks A clone melee auto-attack Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. \u2b25 Hurricane: \u200e \u200eMasuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note: Its possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u2b25 Tsunami: After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using Surge as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits. Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield unlocked, it is possible to Resonance and flick Deflect Mage . This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami. Reso prayer flick demonstration - https://youtu.be/WZlGkkmUsis Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it. Surge timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0 Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. \u2b25 Pulverise After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight phase \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. \u2b25 Shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic . for the duration of this special attack. \u2b25 When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2. Notes: Dominion Mines will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion here to reduce damage taken. You must be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2 Starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. \u2b25 The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used. Strategy \u2b25 Phase 1: + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Hurricane starts after 2 autos: Cancel with + / away, stall from out of distance -> run back in and release with . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Hurricane starts later: Build with 188s. When Masuta starts his Hurricane, time appropriately. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make sure to use Backhand during his Hurricane mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Aim for a 40s-ish phase here. This will make your kill quick and smooth. \u2b25 Build with strong basics until ends, then \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188s until 30% adrenaline, after which + \u2192 . Finish the phase with strong basics. Note: Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channeled abilities. \u2b25 Flight Phase: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start the phase with your Enhanced Excalibur , the waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise Bladed Dive when moving from water to water. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Natural Instinct when ~60 seconds of the flight phase have passed, build to 100% adrenaline and Dragon Battleaxe Spec , build back to 100% adrenaline with basics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is highly recommended (though not strictly necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts. Note: You can use Balanced Strike on the beginning of the phase if you find yourself low on HP. You will have enough time to build back to 100% in order to Natural Instinct and the HP gained will sustain you throughout the phase. \u2b25 Phase 2: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are going for the non-EoF 1 cycle or 2 cycle rotation: + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (2 hit) \u2192 build with basics until ends \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 finish off with strong basics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are going for the EoF 1 cycle rotation: \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 (2 hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics if necessary \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 finish off with strong basics. Section 5 Defence Pylons \u2b25 Surge Bladed Dive past the first 4 Defence Pylons. On the platform with the final bank chest, Greater Barge the middle Pylon and bleed Greater Flurry . \u2b25 Walk to the tile right in front of the bank chest and with a Noxious Scythe , Quake both Pylons. Clean up with good basics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should end this on 100% adrenaline, build with defensives if necessary. Bank and Surge Bladed Dive (as shown below) towards the last boss of the dungeon, Seiryu, the Azure Serpent. Crystal quake example - https://youtu.be/CMzuGgvoAcs Surge Bladed Dive into Seiryu example - https://youtu.be/r8Kuyej0AIs Seiryu, the Azure Serpent To finish the dungeon, you need to free Seiryu by destroying the three black crystals on his shackles. This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics. Drops \u2b25 Ancient scale \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Common drop, 4-110 dropped per kill \u2b25 Chipped black stone crystal \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1/300 base, 60 threshold Note: The above is strictly for solo encounters. Mechanics \u2b25 Overview \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. \u2b25 Tail Blackholes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it. \u2b25 Attack Rotations Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Huge Breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow Energy \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. \u2b25 Huge Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield / Resonance or use Vengeance and tank it. \u2b25 Shadow Energy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path. \u2b25 Black Hands \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent. \u2b25 Crystal Phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu. General Tips \u2b25 1 cycling consistently results in faster kills, but 2 cycling is far easier. \u2b25 Any familiar larger than 1x1, such as the Ripper Demon, will not be able to directly attack the crystals. \u2b25 Keep in mind that you can use Flanking on Seiryu from the south edge of the arena. \u2b25 You will not be attacked while on Seiryu's shackle, avoid healing to make the most out of your Berserker's Fury relic. \u2b25 Using Zamorak Brews to lower down your own HP during crystal phase is highly recommended in order to utilise even more your Berserker's Fury relic. \u2b25 It may be worth to tank the Tail Blackhole first hits in order to finish a channeled threshold or use Flanking . 2 Cycle Seiryu Face Phase \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 (2hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 and build. Optimally when Seiryu reaches 7,200M HP, you will have 100% adrenaline ready for the crystal phase. With this in mind, decide on which/how many thresholds to use depending on how much damage you've dealt to the boss. If your damage output is high, prioritise to ensure is off cooldown for the crystal phase. Note: Avoid using Assault when Seiryu is close to 7,200M, or else it'll be on cooldown for the first crystal rotation. \u2b25 When Seiryu phases at 7,200M HP, Bladed Dive to either side's jump spot (shown below) and spam-click the jump option on the shackle platform. Crystal 1 + \u2192 + drop + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (4 hit) \u2192 . Crystal 2 \u2b25 Before the wave of heals reaches the crystals, you must have used a fully channeled twice and be on 100% adrenaline. Use Natural Instinct before the first enigma reaches Seiryu and build to 100%, then, either 1 or 2 ticks after the first heal hitsplat appears: \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + drop \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 \u2192 . You will be teleported down right after Decimate . Note: Avoid using Freedom to build because it will be used when you get back down to the arena. Second crystal rotation - https://youtu.be/68sb6NH1UtA Second Face Phase \u2b25 If the second crystal was destroyed, you can ignore the enigmas and attack Seiryu: + \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build to 100%. \u2b25 If not, with your Caroming switch on the 3rd or 4th enigma to make all of them attack you.

Crystal 2 \u2b25 If the second crystal was not destroyed, jump up from the same side as you did on the first cycle and + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until crystal is destroyed. \u2b25 Ideally, after finishing it, you will have 100% adrenaline and both Berserk and Greater Barge off cooldown. Note: You will not have Berserk available immediately for the second crystal phase. Crystal 3 + \u2192 + drop + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 \u2192 . Note: wait 3 ticks after killing the second crystal to guarantee Greater Barge effect. Introduction to 1 Cycle Seiryu General Tips \u2b25 These are not the best ways to go for a 1-cycle as a \"one time thing\", it is a way to finish the dungeon quickly to boost runs/hour. \u2b25 BiS or near BiS gear is heavily recommended for consistency. \u2b25 If you are willing to use a separate preset for the Seiryu fight alone, useful items to bring for 1-cycles in particular are: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deathtouch Bracelet \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Armour spikes (alloy) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dreadnips. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Zamorak Brews \u2b25 Even though you cannot use your Ripper Demon directly on the Crystal, its passive will be more helpful than bringing a 1x1 familiar. \u2b25 If you have a Terrasaur Maul make sure to use it during the cast of all 2H abilities and bled Assaults while on the Crystals. 1 Cycle Seiryu (No EoF) (Courtesy of #Onyksi) Note: Phase 1 has no noteworthy changes from the 2-cycle rotation, but the importance of starting crystals with 100% adrenaline is higher here. Crystal 1 + + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 /188s until crystal 1 dies. Crystal 2 + 188/ \u2192 188s until Berserk runs out \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188s \u2192 out of distance \u2192 Defensive \u2192 \u2192 188s \u2192 * \u2192 \u2192 188s/thresholds according to HP/adrenaline. Kill the second crystal before it gets healed and build up to 100% adrenaline. Note: Assault should be used ASAP. You can only afford to lose up to 3 ticks (from climbing/GCD) by this point without having to either alter your rotation for the 3rd crystal or skip using Assault here entirely. Crystal 3 1 tick after the first heal appears, \u2192 Defensive \u2192 + \u2192 s \u2192 r + + \u2192 + \u2192 3hit \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 . Note: before Zerk. 1 Cycle Seiryu (EoF) (Courtesy of #ykro) Note: With the EoF release, the possibility of dumping adrenaline with the Dragon Claws special attack shines in synergy with the small damage window on the 3rd crystal. So it is reasonable to change Masuta P2 and Face Phase in order to finish 1st crystal with Limitless and the 3rd with Adrenaline Renewal . Face Phase + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (2 hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 . At this point you will judge Seiryu's HP. HP \u2264 7,350M You will skip the Zaros Godsword spec so you can Dragon Battleaxe spec in time. Build with basics, use Flanking whenever possible, use thresholds (except Assault ) and make sure you are 100% adrenaline when Seiryu reaches 7,250M HP. HP \u2265 7,350M \u2192 \u2192 build with strong basics, use Flanking whenever you can \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 build to 100% adrenaline before Seiryu reaches 7,250M HP. Pre-Crystal Preparation When Seiryu reaches ~7,255M HP: \u2192 build to 100% with basics \u2192 \u2192 build to 100% again before 7,200M (use defensives to delay phasing if you deem necessary) \u2192 equip your Ring of Vigour \u2192 Bladed Dive to jump spot, and spam-click the jump option. Crystal 1 + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 (it should be destroyed here, use \u2192 if its still standing). Note: Spam the Berserk keybind during the jump animation, so you dont lose any ticks in the process. Crystal 2 + \u2192 basics if zerk still up \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 (4 hit) \u2192 and decide based on your adrenaline and remaining hitpoints of the crystal wether you will Hurricane /Destroy /finish it off with basics. Crystal 3 After killing the second crystal, build to \u2265 92% adrenaline and use + on the last crystal, then click away to activate Greater Barge effect. When the second hitsplat of the first heal wave pops up, wait 2 ticks, then + \u2192 + \u2192 s \u2192 r + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (4 hit) \u2192 \u2192 . Notes : \u2b25 Stalling might be tricky to execute but it increases drastically the burst damage output of the rotation. If you are struggling with it, check out the Stalling section in #mechanics . \u2b25 If, after using Greater Flurry , adrenaline \u2265 45%, use Dragon Claws EoF Spec right away. \u2b25 If middle crystal was destroyed late, skip using Dismember .

Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. His ranged auto-attacks A clone melee auto-attack Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. \u2b25 Hurricane: \u200e \u200eMasuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note: Its possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u2b25 Tsunami: After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using Surge as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits. Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield unlocked, it is possible to Resonance and flick Deflect Mage . This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami. Reso prayer flick demonstration - https://youtu.be/WZlGkkmUsis Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it. Surge timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0 Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. \u2b25 Pulverise After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight phase \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. \u2b25 Shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic . for the duration of this special attack. \u2b25 When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2. Notes: Dominion Mines will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion here to reduce damage taken. You must be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2 Starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. \u2b25 The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used. Strategy \u2b25 Phase 1: + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Hurricane starts after 2 autos: Cancel with + / away, stall from out of distance -> run back in and release with . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Hurricane starts later: Build with 188s.

Finish the phase with strong basics. Note: Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channeled abilities. \u2b25 Flight Phase: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start the phase with your Enhanced Excalibur , the waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise Bladed Dive when moving from water to water. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Natural Instinct when ~60 seconds of the flight phase have passed, build to 100% adrenaline and Dragon Battleaxe Spec , build back to 100% adrenaline with basics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is highly recommended (though not strictly necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts. Note: You can use Balanced Strike on the beginning of the phase if you find yourself low on HP. You will have enough time to build back to 100% in order to Natural Instinct and the HP gained will sustain you throughout the phase. \u2b25 Phase 2: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are going for the non-EoF 1 cycle or 2 cycle rotation: + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (2 hit) \u2192 build with basics until ends \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 finish off with strong basics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are going for the EoF 1 cycle rotation: \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 (2 hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics if necessary \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 finish off with strong basics.","title":"Masuta, the Ascended"},{"location":"pvme-guides/elite-dungeons/temple-of-aminishi-melee/#section-5","text":"Defence Pylons \u2b25 Surge Bladed Dive past the first 4 Defence Pylons.

This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics.

Mechanics \u2b25 Overview \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. \u2b25 Tail Blackholes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it. \u2b25 Attack Rotations Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Huge Breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow Energy \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. \u2b25 Huge Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield / Resonance or use Vengeance and tank it. \u2b25 Shadow Energy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path. \u2b25 Black Hands \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent. \u2b25 Crystal Phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu. General Tips \u2b25 1 cycling consistently results in faster kills, but 2 cycling is far easier. \u2b25 Any familiar larger than 1x1, such as the Ripper Demon, will not be able to directly attack the crystals. \u2b25 Keep in mind that you can use Flanking on Seiryu from the south edge of the arena. \u2b25 You will not be attacked while on Seiryu's shackle, avoid healing to make the most out of your Berserker's Fury relic. \u2b25 Using Zamorak Brews to lower down your own HP during crystal phase is highly recommended in order to utilise even more your Berserker's Fury relic. \u2b25 It may be worth to tank the Tail Blackhole first hits in order to finish a channeled threshold or use Flanking .","title":"Seiryu, the Azure Serpent"},{"location":"pvme-guides/elite-dungeons/temple-of-aminishi-melee/#2-cycle-seiryu","text":"Face Phase \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 (2hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 and build.

Room 3 \u2b25 Build to 100% on Anagamis and Arhats, use Bladed Dive Surge to the south wall of Sanctum's arena, then run to spot shown in picture below (or mirrored if you chose other side): \u2b25 This should block all Arhats and Anagamis behind Sanctum. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should wait here until they have all stopped moving before dodging Sanctum's attacks. Sanctum Guardian The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared. Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage.

They deal negligible ranged damage and generally should not be seen as the boss should be dead before this point anyway. Note: The autoattack that comes after the Purple Smoke can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Deflect Melee for this part and switch to Deflect Missiles during the attacks travel time if necessary. \u2b25 Ranged Autoattacks - A projectile that target the spot the player is standing on and hits everyone in a 3x3 area centred around that spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As it is targetted to a tile rather than the player and has a travel time before it hits, it is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough before the attack lands though this is normally not necessary. \u2b25 Water Burst - A high-hitting melee attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deflect Melee should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Although slower, it is also possible to avoid this attack completely by moving far away from the boss at the right time, or using Resonance if you need the extra healing. How to avoid the water burst attack - https://youtu.be/3xDLQIAMeEc Note: For experienced players, this is not necessary or worthwhile, as you will be able to heal back any necessary HP with Soul Split flicking. \u2b25 Water Jet - A beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Should you get hit by this mechanic, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This attack can be dealt with in several ways, such as dodging with Bladed Dive or blocking with Disruption Shield /Resonance . How to avoid the water jet with Bladed Dive - https://youtu.be/mlPkDWGGmb8 Note: During this mechanic, the boss will face north and stop using autoattacks, you will be able to use Flanking and pray Soul Split here. \u2b25 Purple Smoke - The most dangerous attack of the boss \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A blue bar will appear above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After a moment, this smoke cloud will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Purple Smoke should be placed in a manner that it will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to use Escape at the correct time to place the Purple Smoke next to the southern wall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing this multiple times, be careful to not Escape into a Purple Smoke you've placed previously.

Room 4 \u2b25 Surge east and run towards the next gate with 3 zealots. \u2b25 Bladed Dive diagonally across the bridge: \u2b25 Using Mechanised Chinchompas kill the 3 Zealots with \u2192 while targetting the middle one \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Try to stand South, next to Northern most Zealot to be able to Surge instantly onto stairs after killing them. Note: If you attack one of them before the others can see you, they will walk away from each other and you won't be able to them. Room 5 \u2b25 Use a defensive ability, then bladed Dive on the spot shown in the picture and target the underlined Zealot: \u2b25 Equip , tag Zealot 1 and use \u2192 . \u2b25 Tag Zealot 2 and use \u2192 \u2192 Example: Section 4 Room 1 \u2b25 Use Greater Ricochet with a long range weapon (2h) on one of the 2 Sakadagamis, then step 2 tiles south, 1 tile west and manually run 2 tiles back towards them. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dont get pulled in by using an ability, otherwise the 2 Sotapannas to west will start attacking you. \u2b25 Equip Mechanised Chinchompas and kill them with \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using stuns on them will delay their stuns. Note: You can choose to instead (if you have enough adrenaline).

Surge Bladed Dive north and stand on any of the tiles shown on picture: \u2b25 If standing in white outline(1), target Menaphite Soldier #3. \u2b25 If in green outline(2), target Menaphite Soldier #2 or #3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make sure to not walk into them because this can mess up the lure. You can always walk East, as long as none of them are bound or stunned. \u2b25 Use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 finish with basics if needed. Room 3 \u2b25 Surge Bladed Dive towards the west gate as shown in the picture: \u2b25 Stand on the spot shown in the picture, run 2 tiles west, wait 1 tick and go back: \u2b25 Target the zealot shown in this picture: \u2b25 Equip \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 finish with basics \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build to 100% if not already, Surge towards the chest and bank. \u2b25 After banking step east so you are looking into Masuta's arena, use any defensive and onto stairs to Masuta. Masuta, the Ascended Masuta, the second boss of the dungeon, keeps true to the dungeon's theme of heavy damage dealt and high KO potential. Using a variety of hard-hitting mechanics and boasting attacks from all three combat styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty spike up from the first boss. Drops \u2b25 Onyx dust \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Common drop, 1-29 dropped per kill \u2b25 Masuta's warspear \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Rare drop Phase 1 \u2b25 Attack Rotation Autoattacks \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Autoattacks \u2192 Tsunami \u2192 repeat Mechanics \u2b25 Autoattacks: Mostly Melee-based although he can also uncommonly use Ranged instead. The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. His ranged auto-attacks A clone melee auto-attack Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. \u2b25 Hurricane: \u200e \u200eMasuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note: Its possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u2b25 Tsunami: After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using Surge as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits. Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield unlocked, it is possible to Resonance and flick Deflect Mage . This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami. Reso prayer flick demonstration - https://youtu.be/WZlGkkmUsis Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it. Surge timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0 Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. \u2b25 Pulverise After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight phase \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. \u2b25 Shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic . for the duration of this special attack. \u2b25 When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2. Notes: Dominion Mines will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion here to reduce damage taken. You must be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2 Starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. \u2b25 The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used. Strategy \u2b25 Start Notes: This rotation requires the Heightened senses relic.

Kill Example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agjfrQ5JfBo Section 5 Room 1 \u2b25 Use Surge Bladed Dive on minimap onto west stairs, target middle Pylon and use \u2192 after releasing \u2192 on either of the 2 south Pylons: \u2b25 \u2192 the last Pylon (basics if not 100% adren), get to 88%+ with defensives on the remaining Pylons without attacking them. \u2b25 Use and \u2192 to get behind Seiryu's head. Seiryu, the Azure Serpent To finish the dungeon, you need to free Seiryu by destroying the three black crystals on his shackles. This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics. Drops \u2b25 Ancient scale \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Common drop, 4-110 dropped per kill \u2b25 Chipped black stone crystal \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1/300 base, 60 threshold Note: The above is strictly for solo encounters. Mechanics \u2b25 Overview \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. \u2b25 Tail Blackholes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it. \u2b25 Attack Rotations Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Huge Breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow Energy \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. \u2b25 Huge Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield / Resonance or use Vengeance and tank it. \u2b25 Shadow Energy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path. \u2b25 Black Hands \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent. \u2b25 Crystal Phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu.

The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. His ranged auto-attacks A clone melee auto-attack Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. \u2b25 Hurricane: \u200e \u200eMasuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note: Its possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u2b25 Tsunami: After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using Surge as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits. Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield unlocked, it is possible to Resonance and flick Deflect Mage . This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami. Reso prayer flick demonstration - https://youtu.be/WZlGkkmUsis Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it. Surge timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0 Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. \u2b25 Pulverise After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight phase \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. \u2b25 Shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic . for the duration of this special attack. \u2b25 When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2. Notes: Dominion Mines will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion here to reduce damage taken. You must be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2 Starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. \u2b25 The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance.

Mechanics \u2b25 Overview \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. \u2b25 Tail Blackholes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it. \u2b25 Attack Rotations Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Huge Breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow Energy \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. \u2b25 Huge Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield / Resonance or use Vengeance and tank it. \u2b25 Shadow Energy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path. \u2b25 Black Hands \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent. \u2b25 Crystal Phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu.

Rotations are written to utilize the Greater Chain ability and assume 4TAA is used; however, neither is required to effectively do this dungeon. Each solo run of ED3 is worth 22,909,091 in eldritch pieces. Advanced players can get up to 3.5 kph, earning on average 80,181,818 gp/hr. General Notes \u2b25 The rotations listed for the bosses are for an advanced setup, lower tiered set-ups will require improvisation. \u2b25 It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double Surge to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia. \u2b25 Consider downgrading your graphics to Minimum with Medium+ draw distance for the Dungeon, as it is poorly optimized and prone to frame drops. \u2b25 You can Surge or Bladed Dive a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry. Presets Note: The dungeon can be effectively run with a single preset but for general speed reasons a separate preset should be used for Ambassador. Universal \u2b25 Undead Slayer ability \u2b25 Undead Slayer perk \u2b25 Salve Amulet for undead mobs and Taraket \u2b25 Cinderbane Gloves \u2b25 Spiritual Prayers - use with a Ripper Demon familiar. \u2b25 Weapon Poison \u2b25 Maniacal Aura Note: Mahjarrat Aura is also ok and makes the Taraket strategy noticeably easier to execute. Optional \u2b25 A few empty inventory spaces if picking up charm drops. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Elite Dungeon chest upgrade solves this issue. \u2b25 Adjust food as seen fit. \u2b25 Lucky Charms \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Doesn't increase Eldritch drop rate. \u2b25 Flanking 4 - not super impactful especially in solo.

First Floor - Pre-Crassian Note: All Greater Chain are assumed to be done with the Caroming 4 perk. Room 1 Tag mob 3 with \u2192 \u2192 (tc mob 2) \u2192 (tc mob 1) \u2192 run past mob 4 and use . Room 2 Surge and run straight along the path before bladed diving behind the Scouts. \u200e \u200eTag the northern most Scout with gChain then charge Detonate \u2192 (tc) . and into the next room. Room 3 Tag with (dw) gChain \u2192 and clean up the survivors. Room 4 There's only two Cloaked Zealots to clear here and they're lined up for AoEs but if you're quick your Detonate will still be on cooldown from Room 2. \u200e \u200eDo \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / . Bladed dive \u2192 surge into the next room as shown below. Room 5 There are two Crassian Scouts and two Cloaked Zealots spaced apart here. gChain one of the Zealots and use Asphyxiate . Clean up any stragglers with basics. Bladed dive diagonally into the next room. Note: Here and anywhere else in the mob sections of this guide, when using \u2192 you should not auto in between as it is important that your main target does not die early. Room 6A Equip your salve amulet and tag a Zombie with gChain . Charge Detonate \u2192 (tc) . Bladed dive diagonally across the rock to Room 6B. Room 6B Use Corruption Blast first if gChain is still on cooldown. Otherwise use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Room 7 Spam surge to use it as soon as you can. Aim to gChain a more central Zombie to ensure it reaches the Zombie close to the barrier. Use either Wild Magic or Guthix Staff here depending on speed and clean up with autos and bleeds. Blade dive diagonally into the next room. Room 8 You only need to kill the two Zealots. Detonate \u2192 \u2192 should be adequate to clear this room and end on high adren for Leviathan. The Crassian Leviathan As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss heals passively over the duration of the fight, largely negated with Weapon Poison active. Mechanics \u2b25 Poison Pits + Additional Heads - The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the Leviathan. Never stand here. \u2b25 Dragon Breath - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage. Stand off to the side to avoid this. \u2b25 Head Sweep - The Leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins. \u2b25 After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps , the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bladed Dive + Surge to the opposite end of the arena. Strategy \u2b25 Aim to Sunshine right away either directly in front of the Leviathan's nose or on the same tile you throw vuln bombs to (directly east of the Leviathan's head). Both spots allow for you to safely hit the boss in while avoiding the Head Sweep special. Drink your apot and look to use \u2192 . \u2b25 At this point the Head Sweep will have started. Use an Guthix Staff spec either before or after you move to dodge the Head Sweep followed by a Detonate after dodging once. Get in another \u2192 \u2192 before you ends. \u2b25 After your ends, try to just use thresholds to do damage up until it switches sides. If your damage doesn't look too great when you hit about the 1 minute mark, try to build to high adren to use a Metaphoris + Limitless immediately after the switch. Otherwise look to finish the boss off with more thresholds and Guthix Staff specs after the switch. Note: Leviathan switching sides counts as walking for Combust so look to use that as one of your last abilities on the initial side. \u2b25 Example Kill: https://youtu.be/wdwPoXs06q0 Post-Crassian - Second Floor Entry Room 9 Drink your Acceleration Powerburst exiting the Leviathan and utilize surge and bladed dive as demonstrated below to quickly reach this room. There is a Cloaked Zealot and various Scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. gChain the Zealot and use Asphyxiate followed by Dragonbreath . If your does not hit all the Scuttlers, you may want to use Corruption Blast before . Diagonally bladed dive into the next room. Room 10 Put your salve amulet back on. In the middle of the room, tag a Zombie with gChain and charge Detonate \u2192 (tc) . Surge \u2192 bladed dive \u2192 to reach the cliff. Room 11 Jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons. Use gChain \u2192 Asphyxiate on the Necromancer to clear the entire room. Room 12 There are two Necromancers off at the sides and a line of three Armoured Zombies guarding the door. You only need to kill one Necromancer and the Zombies to proceed to section 2, the temple area. Run to the archway and surge straight before diagonally bladed diving towards a Necromancer. Kill the Necromancer with Wild Magic \u2192 Combust . Use gChain on an Armoured Zombie and charge Detonate \u2192 . Second Floor Entry - Taraket Entry Room 1 There are two Ulthven Necromancers guarding the gates to the east and west that you must clear to access the black stone artefacts. The main gate will not drop until these have been activated. A mass of summoned skeletons will form in the room as you go about this task. Equip your and surge + bladed dive down the path. Go west first and kill the Necromancer with \u2192 \u2192 . through the open barrier to go tag the artefact. diagonally back to the doorway and through. Kill the east Necromancer with \u2192 and towards the doorway. Go tag the artefact then run back and diagonally towards the bridge. Demonstrated: https://youtu.be/dGDwdi6PojI Room 2 Surge twice down the bridge to the two Sea Horrors and a Necromancer that you must clear to proceed. Use gChain \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Dragonbreath on the east Horror while running to the far northeast corner. Charge Detonate on the west Horror \u2192 . The Necromancer should die to AoE during this clear but kill with basics if it suvives. Diagonally bladed dive to the next hallway afterwards. Note: It is ok to use Devotion here, but it should ideally be before reaching the Horrors. Room 3 There's a line of three Acolytes of Seiryu guarding the gate here that must be cleared to proceed. Tag the northernmost Acolyte with gChain and use Wild Magic before switching targets. Finish off the survivors with Dragonbreath and Corruption Blast . Immediately after clearing this room, drink your Acceleration Powerburst to bladed dive back to back to back as demonstrated below. Room 4 There are many mobs here but only the Necromancers and Huge Skeletons must be cleared. Put your salve amulet back on and use gChain \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Dragonbreath on the western Necromancer. Finish off what's left with basics, but try not to use Corruption Blast as it will stop your from banking at the chest. Taraket the Necromancer This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket, Corpses and Skeletons are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet , Undead Slayer perk and sigil purposes. Mechanics \u2b25 Rift of Undeath - \u200e \u200eThis Rift with 30k HP will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode for heavy typeless damage to the player. Prevented by killing it. \u2b25 Death's Swiftness - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones. \u2b25 Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket. \u2b25 Spirit Line - Taraket smashes the ground infront of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits infront of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Move out of the way as needed be. Strategy \u2b25 Utilizing 4TAA with Blood Barrage and gChain will make a world of difference in this fight in particular allowing players to essentially tank almost everything, especially on Mahjarrat Aura rather than Maniacal . \u200e \u200eWith , the last 300k can be sketchy at times; however, it is very much worth using. \u2b25 Start out the fight with an apot Sunshine and your salve amulet equipped. \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (\u2192 if Taraket is still above 200k hp) / the Rift \u2192 to clear the skeletons \u2192 + the Bloated Monstrosity \u2192 run back to just west of where Taraket was before flying and charge on him \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (\u2192 \u2192 if not phased but try to stay high adren) Note: Where you stand is important here as you're looking to body block Taraket from flying west. \u2b25 Equip \u2192 on the Bloated Monstrosity and build back to 100 to back on Taraket and build with 2 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 step to the other side of Taraket before the Corpse Carrier reaches melee distance to effective stack it on top of Taraket Blocking + + Stacking Demonstrated: Note: Stacking Corpse Carrier in this way is not 100% guranteed and it is very important that you move back through Taraket to restack if it does not work. \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ends) \u2b25 From here finish off taraket with more thresholds and . Be sure to side step the melee hits from the Spirit Line special as they will severly hurt your ability to outheal the majority of the damage you take. Also use off cooldown (preferably before thresholds or ) to improve overall healing and to repeatedly clear out the skeletal mobs the Corpse Carrier spawns. A second rift will spawn but you should be killing Taraket before it explodes so you can generally ignore it. \u2b25 The Dark Form prayer is helpful here especially if using Spiritual Prayers . Note: Untested but players who do not 4TAA can likely follow this strategy up until when the Corpse Carrier spawns, at which point they would want to focus it down while in Sunshine . \u2b25 Example Kill: https://youtu.be/qhA1C_HZrPQ Taraket Exit - Second Floor Exit Note: This section and the following section can be cleared fairly easily with little to no food. As such, do not bank after Taraket even if running low. Room 5 Surge + bladed dive \u2192 out of Taraket's room. There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. Tag the Witch with gChain \u2192 Asphxyiate /Wild Magic /Guthix Staff depending on cooldowns following Taraket. into the next room. Room 6 Put back on your Essence of Finality . Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss. If you have it, the Demon Slayer ability can be used here. Guthix staff (dw) \u2192 Asphyxiate /Wild Magic should be enough. The Demon Slayer ability can be used here if you already own it. After killing the demon, look to utilize surge and bladed dive and an Acceleration Powerburst as demonstrated below. Note: You can manipulate one of the required Necromancers in room 7 to move from his position to make the next room easier on you by running as close as you can to him, so he aggros you through the wall. This isn\u2019t 100% guaranteed. Room 7 There's two Necromancers hiding around in this room that need to be cleared. Use either Wild Magic or Guthix Staff followed by Combust on the west Necromancer then surge back towards the east Necromancer. If low on Hp or food use gChain \u2192 Asphyxiate on the east Necromancer, otherwise simply . Diagonally bladed dive through the corner into the next room and keep running to angle yourself for the next surge . Room 8 Only the two Necromancers are guarding the gate here. Kill the first Necromancer with Sonic \u2192 Guthix Staff then surge diagonally through the corner to the second Necromancer. Kill it with Wild Magic \u2192 Corruption Blast and diagonally bladed dive through the corner to the cliff. Third Floor Entry - Pre-Ambassador Room 1 Use surge twice to reach the group of Crassian Warriors and Scuttlers around the gate that must be killed. They stack up very nicely for all AoEs and aren't very threatening in general. Tag a Warrior with gChain \u2192 Combust on your way to the barrier and charge a Detonate \u2192 \u2192 (\u2192 \u2192 if bad ). Improvise to finish off the survivors. Room 2 There's two Warped Skeletons in here that can completely clear you if you aren't paying attention. Equip your salve amulet and gChain the two Skeletons. Proceed to Asphyxiate \u2192 (tc skeleton 2) \u2192 . Surge into the next room and immediately bladed dive behind the line of Zealots. Room 3 Re-equip your Essence of Finality and use gChain on either one of the eastern Zealots or Skeleton if close. From here use Tsunami then improvise to finish off the stragglers ideally with Detonate . Room 4 The last room before the final boss of the dungeon. There are two more skeletons along with two Crassian Scouts that need to be cleared to proceed. There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so try to avoid them by hugging the western wall. Ideally look to gChain the Skeletons \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Combust /Corruption Blast . Build on the Scouts to ensure you have full adren for Ambassador. Note: If no minibosses spawn in this room, look to zoom to the door and all 4 mobs. Kranon, the Ambassador At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits Kranon, the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, self-healing, and the usage multiple combat styles. The boss primarily attacks with ranged , with a heavy mage attack after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe if the player is in melee distance. Ambassador's Attack Rotation \u2b25 1M HP to 550K - Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Mage/Melee auto \u2192 5 autos \u2192 Purple Corruption \u2192 5 autos \u200e \u200e\u2192 Black Hole \u2192 5 autos \u200e \u200e\u2192 Purple Corruption \u2192 5 autos \u200e \u200e\u2192 Sinister Fragments \u2192 Repeat Magic Auto-Attack \u2b25 550K to 400K - Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual. \u2b25 Ritual - Kill \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 5 autos \u2192 Melee/Magic \u2192 5 autos \u2192 Melee/Magic \u2192 Onslaught 1M-550K HP \u2b25 Purple Corruption \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until Seiryu clears them at the Ritual phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and will ramp up to 2000 typeless damage to anyone standing inside. \u2b25 Black Hole \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Ambassador will spawn a black hole near the area that will explode a few seconds afterwards, dealing 8000+ damage to the player \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Despawned by stunning it. \u2b25 Sinister Fragments \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Failing to destroy a fragment(s) prompts the Ambassador to absorb them, and release a hard hitting typeless explotion per fragment absorbed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 He'll use the Fragments one minute into the fight or by hitting the 650K cap. Burn! Like the ants you are. A fragment is absorbed 550K-400K HP \u2b25 The Ambassador stops spawning Sinister Fragments. \u2b25 The Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage, making Resonance harder to use. 400K-0 HP \u2b25 The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics, continuing his auto attack pattern as normal. \u2b25 Seiryu will emerge shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas. \u2b25 A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the Ambassador. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player. Seiryu arrives Ritual begins \u2b25 Magic Onslaught \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u200e \u200eEvery 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks. Ambassador Strategy General Tips \u2b25 Use a Ripper demon with scrolls and drink Spiritual Prayers . \u2b25 Try to avoid using solid food. Stick to Blue jellies , and Guthix rest or Saradomin brews , if you can. \u2b25 Try to maximize the potential healing from soulsplitting Spinners and the Seiryu Heal at 400k to cut down on food usage throughout the fight. Resonance can also be used on the magic auto attack occasionally to preserve food. \u2b25 You will need to Spellbook Swap to use Disruption Shield throughout the fight. Bring runes accordingly. \u2b25 Flanking can be utilized throughout the fight by stepping directly underneath the Ambassador. Phase 1 - 1M-650k HP Note: Most autos and basics will be omitted in the rotations below. If either is listed below, the timing achieved is intentional. Also all Detonate are charged for 3 ticks. \u2b25 Magic 1st Auto vs Melee 1st Auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Doing \u2192 (during gcd) to reach melee distance instantly at the start of the fight will switch the 1st auto into a melee auto. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Changing the 1st auto into a melee auto changes the timing of the 1st smoke. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Mage 1st auto leads to a 22.8s (38t) 1st smoke drop. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Melee 1st auto leads to a 31.8s (53t) 1st smoke drop. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No other timings are changed. Note: The rotation in this guide assumes Magic 1st auto for timings. \u2b25 Start the Fight with an Apot Sunshine \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Disruption Shield while running down the ramp + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 run to the north/northwest corner of your while waiting to auto \u2192 \u2192 (1st smoke timer will start + switch to for the 2nd magic auto) \u2192 \u2192 move out of smoke \u2192 (3rd magic auto) \u2192 \u2192 clear black hole with immediately (timer will be close to ending) ( ends) build with basics \u2192 \u2192 (2nd smoke timer starts) \u2192 (4th magic auto will come out towards the end of smoke timer) \u2192 move out of smoke \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2b25 Phase 1 Tips \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Try to place the 2nd smoke next to your 1st smoke. This will put them out of the way as after spinners you will primarily stay south/southwest of Ambassador while also leaving a large path on the east side for pathing during spinners. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you switch prayers properly and the last magic auto attack, it is fairly straight forward to no food phase 1 starting from full hp. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Depending on where the black hole spawns, you may need to start moving early to reach it in time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Be careful that you do not stall then cancel . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Having the flanking perk equipped will cause to not clear the black hole. Phase 2 - Spinners \u2b25 Spinner Strategy (not all basics listed) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1st: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 2nd: \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 3rd: \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 4th: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 5th: \u2192 basics \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 6th: ignore and build on Ambassador \u2b25 Spinners Tips \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You only need to kill 5 out of 6 and then use either or to block the explosion hit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No movement abilities are required to effectively move between spinners; however, if desired, it is recommended to use Bladed Dive as its cooldown will be reset by each spinner death. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using Vulnerability bombs on each of the spinners is not necessary but recommended. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The spinners are not immune to binds and therefore Ice Barrage + Wrack can be utilized. Phase 3 - 650k-400k \u2b25 Natural Instinct Sunshine \u2192 3-4 basics \u2192 the eruption \u2192 \u2192 (5th magic auto) \u2192 (3rd smoke timer start) \u2192 \u2192 move \u2192 (6th magic auto) \u2192 \u2192 clear black hole with immediately build with basics \u2192 (7th magic auto) (if bad adren skip to not delay next ) \u2192 (dw) \u2b25 Phase 3 Tips \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are confident in your ability to on tick, you can the 7th magic auto here to save food. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Try to end this phase on very low hp for a large heal from Seiryu but beware as flicking to to block a magic auto will still cost you somewhere around 2-3k hp. Phase 4 - Ritual (400k-0 HP) \u2b25 General Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blocking the Healing Smoke \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Understand your character as a wedge when blocking smoke. You can always block 2 smoke directions at once so whenever you have to move, rather than moving to block the current smoke, move to block the current smoke and the next smoke . For this reason it is also more beneficial to move to melee distance for this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Alternatively you can spam click under him to block all of the healing smoke without needing to move, though this is also the most click-intensive and difficult thing you can do. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blocking Magic Onslaught (from most to least ideal) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Devotion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Reflect + Vitality Powerburst \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Reflect + Debilitate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Vitality Powerburst + Shield Dome Note: is very dangerous and is only to save kills following misjudgements. You should never want to use this method. Timing a for hp or using to block the 1st hit of Magic Onslaught also helps this method but adds even more risk. \u2b25 Apot Sunshine \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run underneath and activate Sunshine . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This will allow you to move to block smokes while remaining in . + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (sun ends) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Devotion to block the Magic Onslaught Note: Very unideal but depending on the timing you may need to activate Limitless to . \u2b25 Last 100k or So \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Depending on the hp remaining, you have 3 options here. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The right option is a judgement call and takes practice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Factors to consider include: hp remaining, food remaining, availability, dps, and confidence \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Safe and Slow - use a thresh or 2 then build to Sunshine \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build (save ) + eat \u2192 \u2192 + the 2nd Magic Onslaught (may come before or after asphyx) \u2192 improvise with thresh \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This option is slow as it generally will not finish the kill until some time after the 2nd Magic Onslaught; however, this option is the safest as it always has access to a safe approach to dealing with the Onslaught. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 All-in for the Skip - use a thresh then build to \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 2 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This option should be fairly consistent in skipping; however, it leaves you in a bad way if you fail the skip with the only option being to resort to . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Example: https://youtu.be/sjP9TMF_0nM \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Speed - assuming hp remaining is fairly low, spam thresh and Guthix Staff EoF to kill before 2nd Magic Onslaught \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This option is the fastest as it is not restricted by cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you choose this option and fail to skip the 2nd Magic Onslaught, eat up and use to hopefully survive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you choose this method and consistently fail to skip, consider trying the All-in method. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Example: https://youtu.be/p11g8eljI9o Example Kill https://youtu.be/NFtB7jfFULo Example Runs https://youtu.be/AzzzO^^05-Q 15:24 by #Akva https://youtu.be/5DvBhiZM3iY 17:37 (pre-gChain) by #Linie","title":"The shadow reef magic"},{"location":"pvme-guides/elite-dungeons/the-shadow-reef-magic/#the-shadow-reef-magic","text":"","title":"The shadow reef magic"},{"location":"pvme-guides/elite-dungeons/the-shadow-reef-magic/#the-shadow-reef-courtesy-of-linie-akva","text":"Introduction The third installment in the Elite Dungeon series, the Shadow Reef is home to the long awaited boss known as Kranon, the Ambassador , which drops pieces for the T92 weapon: the Eldritch Crossbow This guide is structured in the order that rooms would be encountered if running the dungeon.

Be sure to side step the melee hits from the Spirit Line special as they will severly hurt your ability to outheal the majority of the damage you take. Also use off cooldown (preferably before thresholds or ) to improve overall healing and to repeatedly clear out the skeletal mobs the Corpse Carrier spawns. A second rift will spawn but you should be killing Taraket before it explodes so you can generally ignore it. \u2b25 The Dark Form prayer is helpful here especially if using Spiritual Prayers . Note: Untested but players who do not 4TAA can likely follow this strategy up until when the Corpse Carrier spawns, at which point they would want to focus it down while in Sunshine . \u2b25 Example Kill: https://youtu.be/qhA1C_HZrPQ","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/elite-dungeons/the-shadow-reef-magic/#taraket-exit-second-floor-exit","text":"Note: This section and the following section can be cleared fairly easily with little to no food.

First Floor - Pre Crassian Room 1 GBarge the eastern crassian scout and bleed Assault on it. Move to the spot two squares north of the other scout and Hurricane , hitting all four enemies. Finish off with Cleave \u2192 Quake . Room 2 Use GFlurry on the scouts, hitting as much scuttlers and scouts as possible. Finish with Cleave \u2192 Hurricane . Room 3 Move to the center of the cluster and Meteor Strike . Cleave \u2192 Quake should finish the job afterwards Room 4 Use Hurricane , GFlurry , and Quake on the Zealots to kill them. How to cut the corner: Room 5 There are two Crassian Scouts and two Cloaked Zealots spaced apart here. Line up your Cleave , Hurricane , and Quake to hit everything in one go. You only need to kill the two Scouts and Zealots to move to the next room. Room 6 \u2b25 Hit the first group with Cleave then keep running past while putting on your salve amulet. \u2b25 Quake the second group, then run back to the middle to lure both groups of zombies next to you. \u2b25 Hurricane and finish off the rest with Bladed Dive (with Laceration boots) and GFlurry . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you have it available, Meteor Strike is good but you likely won\u2019t have it back in time. Room 7 GBarge a zombie, Cleave , then target the 20k armored zombie and bleed Assault on it. Then run back to the zombie you used Barge on and AoE with what you have available. Room 8 You only need to kill the two Zealots here to proceed. Use GFlurry and Cleave and prepare your gear for the next boss, watching your adrenaline and amulets. The Crassian Leviathan As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss heals passively over the duration of the fight, largely negated with Weapon Poison active. Mechanics \u2b25 Poison Pits + Additional Heads - The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the Leviathan. Never stand here. \u2b25 Dragon Breath - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage. Stand off to the side to avoid this. \u2b25 Head Sweep - The Leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins. \u2b25 After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps , the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bladed Dive + Surge to the opposite end of the arena. Strategy For whatever reason, the Crassian Leviathan actually has decent defense so beware if not using Berserker . Both strategies utilize channeled abilities and spamclicking the ground to stay on 2 specific \"safe tiles\" on either side of Crass's head during the Dragon Breath and Head Sweep mechanics. \u200e \u200eIf used correctly, you do not need a scythe to melee this boss. \u2b25 Standard 1 Cycle Your target is to pop Berserk and ZGS spec during the fight to finish him. + \u2192 \u2192 bleed \u2192 \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (2-3 hit) \u2b25 2 Zerk 1 Cycle Slower but potentially more consistent than the standard rotation -- your objective is to use gFlurry to reduce the cooldown of Berserk , allowing for 2 s in the roughly 1:10 time frame. This rotation does not work if you do not have Limitless . + \u2192 \u2192 bleed \u2192 \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 \u2192 ( if good adren) \u2192 (4 hit) \u2192 \u2192 188 \u2192 bleed \u2192 2 188s (1 if impatient proc) \u2192 / depending on HP Note: With this rotation, you are looking to the second time as soon as it comes off cooldown. Post-Crassian - Second Floor Entry Room 9 There is a Cloaked Zealot and various Scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. GBarge one of the scouts for both the Barge buff and faster movement. Bleed Assault on the zealot, then immediately target a Scuttler to Hurricane and Quake . Room 10 Wait for them to MD you and use Meteor Strike with a few AoEs. Room 11 Run down a long path and jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons. There's not much to this room but focusing the necromancer will clear the skeletons in the AoE available. Save the following abilities for next Room: Cleave and GFlurry Room 12 Kill one of the Necromancers with a walked Slaughter \u2192 Decimate . Then quickly move to the zombies guarding the entrance to the temple itself. Cleave and GFlurry the zombies, then finish off with good basics. Second Floor Entry - Taraket Entry Room 1 \u2b25 Go to either necromancer and GBarge (with Mobile) \u2192 Assault . \u2b25 Kill that necromancer and activate the artifact, \u2b25 Go to the other necromancer and GBarge (with Mobile again) \u2192 GFlurry , then activate the artifact. Room 2 \u2b25 Use Devotion right as you start moving into the bridge and Bladed Dive + Surge to the end immediately mid-GCD, \u2b25 GBarge one of the sea horrors. \u2b25 Bleed Assault on it, then target the necromancer to Hurricane . \u2b25 Cleave \u2192 Quake the horror you didn\u2019t attack to kill both the first horror and the necromancer. \u2b25 Finish off the horror with other strong basics to proceed. Room 3 There's a line of three Acolytes of Seiryu guarding the gate here that must be cleared to proceed. They are melee and line up well for AoEs. Room 4 \u2b25 Bladed Dive + Surge through the staircase as marked to avoid aggroing the four acolytes \u2b25 Go all the way to the next gate. There are many mobs here but only the necromancers and Huge Skeletons must be cleared. \u2b25 Start with a Meteor Strike and finish off all the mobs with other AoE abilities, but make sure to have high adrenaline as the next room is the second boss, Taraket the Necromancer. Taraket the Necromancer This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket, Corpses and Skeletons are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet , Undead Slayer perk and sigil purposes. Mechanics \u2b25 Rift of Undeath - \u200e \u200eThis Rift with 30k HP will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode for heavy typeless damage to the player. Prevented by killing it. \u2b25 Death's Swiftness - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones. \u2b25 Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket. \u2b25 Spirit Line - Taraket smashes the ground infront of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits infront of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Move out of the way as needed be. Strategy There are three different methods to this: Killing both bloats for maximum safety, killing only the Corpse carrier immediately to balance safety with speed, and just DPSing Taraket and tanking both bloats. What you do will slightly affect your rotation, but the overall goals remain the same. \u2b25 Opener \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Berserk to GBarge . and don't use Adrenaline Potions immediately as you\u2019d want to save it for later. Instead, just use to get your thresholds off. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you were quick and started the fight while you still have your Meteor Strike buff from the previous room, the amount of adrenaline you will gain from critical hits will let you go bleed Assault \u2192 \u200e \u200e (3 hit) \u2192 Destroy for the most optimal DPS rotation without an adrenaline potion. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump the rest of your strong basics and the portal should spawn right before Taraket phases. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Activate Undead Slayer right when you use your next ability after Assault. Safety V Speed \u2b25 ZGS on Taraket (the best way) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 GBarge as soon as he\u2019s available to be hit with dual wield \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Swap to ZGS to spec \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Swap to your Maul to get a lossless 2h auto for high damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bleed Assault , saving Hurricane right before the 200k mark. \u2b25 Killing the Corpse Carrier instantly, (slower, but much safer) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 GBarge \u2192 GFlurry \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Slaughter to Meteor Strike as more skeletons spawn from the corpse carrier for maximum adrenaline refunds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Right after it\u2019s dead, use Berserk \u2192 GBarge + Adren Pot \u200e \u200e \u2192 bleed Thresholds and finish Taraket off. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use ZGS spec after your Berserk wears. Activate your Undead Slayer under Berserk \u2b25 Ignoring the Corpse Carrier (Riskier and much faster) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Berserk \u2192 GBarge immediately when Taraket can be damaged again and simply outeat everything. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is extremely risky, but can be done fairly well even with blubbers and Guthix rests. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As your ZGS spec will still be on cooldown, finish off the rest of the kill with strong Basics and Thresholds. Taraket Exit - Second Floor Exit Room 5 \u2b25 There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Surge behind the Sea Witch, traping the skeletons behind the witch and cleave down with Scythe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Don't use Assault because you\u2019ll want to save it for the next room. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Beware of delayed Sea Witch's magic auto attack after killing it. \u2b25 Setting up Necromancer lure in room 7: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Check your minimap to see if the skeleton is at the southern wall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It can be aggroed from any tile on that wall except for the southeastern corner. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bladed Dive + Surge into room 6 towards the wall sticking to the rocks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This will aggro the skeleton and chain aggro the necromancer with it. Room 6 Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss, activate Demon Slayer and GBarge \u2192 Assault the Kal\u2019gerion demon. Finish off with more strong basics and thresholds. If the skeleton in room 7 was not aggroed while you were in room 6, you can aggro it here. Room 7 There's two necromancers hiding around in this room that need to be cleared. Dump some thresholds and proceed. If you aggroed the far necromancer from the previous rooms, it should be coming towards you as you come up to the corridor. GBarge the necromancer coming towards you, bleed the other, then finish off the first one with thresholds. Room 8 Another two Necromancers are guarding the gate here so just continue picking them off. The Sea Witches and Magister miniboss that can spawn at the east side of the room have a fairly large aggro range so preferably hug the wall as you enter. Use Quake and Decimate the first Necromancer immediately. Slaughter and Surge at the exact same time to finish it off and move yourself quickly through the dungeon. Get on the other necromancer and finish it off with strong abilities. Finally, dive into the abyss to enter the final section of the dungeon. Third Floor Entry - Pre-Ambassador Room 1 Move to the gate and GBarge a Crassian warrior. Bleed Assault on it, and let the rest of the warriors gather to you, then finish them off with AoE's. Save Meteor Strike for Room 3. Room 2 Two Warped Skeletons in here that can completely clear you if you aren't paying attention. The skeletons can deal a moderate mage hit frequently, healing themselves while dealing 2000-3000 damage to you, be careful. Room 3 Use Meteor Strike and AoE the enemies all in one go and finish off the rest of the mobs however you see fit. Room 4 The last room before the final boss of the dungeon. There are two more skeletons along with two Crassian Scouts that need to be cleared to proceed. They're pretty spread out so just dps and make sure to be on high adrenaline for the encounter with The Ambassador. There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so avoid them by quickly Bladed Dive + Surging . GBarge the Crassian Scouts and finish off the rest of the mobs, but try not to use Assault so you can more quickly use it for the start of Ambassador if you don\u2019t want to wait. Kranon, the Ambassador At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, and self-healing, as well as utilizing multiple combat styles. The boss primarily attacks with ranged , with a heavy mage attack after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe if the player is in melee distance. Ambassador's Attack Rotation \u2b25 1M HP to 550K - Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Mage/Melee auto \u2192 5 autos \u2192 Purple Corruption \u2192 5 autos \u200e \u200e\u2192 Black Hole \u2192 5 autos \u200e \u200e\u2192 Purple Corruption \u2192 5 autos \u200e \u200e\u2192 Sinister Fragments \u2192 Repeat Magic Auto-Attack \u2b25 550K to 400K - Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual. \u2b25 Ritual - Kill \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 5 autos \u2192 Melee/Magic \u2192 5 autos \u2192 Melee/Magic \u2192 Onslaught 1M-550K HP \u2b25 Purple Corruption \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until Seiryu clears them at the Ritual phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and will ramp up to 2000 typeless damage to anyone standing inside. \u2b25 Black Hole \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Ambassador will spawn a black hole near the area that will explode a few seconds afterwards, dealing 8000+ damage to the player \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Despawned by stunning it. \u2b25 Sinister Fragments \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Failing to destroy a fragment(s) prompts the Ambassador to absorb them, and release a hard hitting typeless explotion per fragment absorbed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 He'll use the Fragments one minute into the fight or by hitting the 650K cap. *Burn! Like the ants you are! A fragment is absorbed 550K-400K HP \u2b25 The Ambassador stops spawning Sinister Fragments. \u2b25 The Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage, making Resonance harder to use. 400K-0 HP \u2b25 The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics, continuing his auto attack pattern as normal. \u2b25 Seiryu will emerge shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas. \u2b25 A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the Ambassador. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player. Seiryu arrives Ritual begins \u2b25 Magic Onslaught \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u200e \u200eEvery 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks. Ambassador Strategy General Tips \u2b25 Use a Ripper demon with scrolls and drink Spiritual Prayers . \u2b25 Berserker Aura is ideal. Otherwise Mahjarrat Aura is also ok. \u2b25 If you have TMW , try to avoid using solid food. Stick to Blue jellies , Guthix rest , and Saradomin brews . \u2b25 Try to maximize the potential healing from soulsplitting Spinners and the Seiryu Heal at 400k to cut down on food usage throughout the fight. Phase 1 - 1M-650k HP Your main goal P1 is to maximize your time spent in melee distance doing damage to Ambassador. \u2b25 Start the fight with an Apot Berserk rotation . + \u2192 \u2192 bleed \u2192 \u2192 (3 hit) \u2b25 Mage 1st Auto vs Melee 1st Auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Doing \u2192 (during gcd) \u2192 will switch the 1st auto into a melee auto. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Changing the 1st auto into a melee auto changes the timing of the 1st smoke. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Mage 1st auto leads to a 22.8s (38t) 1st smoke drop. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Melee 1st auto leads to a 31.8s (53t) 1st smoke drop. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No other timings are changed. Note: The rotation in this guide assumes Mage 1st auto for timings. \u2b25 1st Smoke \u2192 \u2192 place smoke \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Place the 1st smoke in melee distance northeast of Ambassador. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If north is 12 on a clock, you want to place the 1st smoke at 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If looking to utilize walk under flank , you should place this smoke 1 square out of md to keep underneath free of smoke. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After placing the smoke, run through Ambassador and Zgs .

First Floor - Pre Crassian Room 1 \u2b25 Attack the closest Crassian scout and wait until both scouts are stacked.

Entry to the room Entry to Crassian The Crassian Leviathan As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss heals passively over the duration of the fight, greatly reduced by having Weapon Poison active. Mechanics \u2b25 Poison Pits + Additional Heads - The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the Leviathan. Never stand here. \u2b25 Dragon Breath - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage. Stand off to the side to avoid this. \u2b25 Head Sweep - The Leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins. \u2b25 After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps , the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bladed Dive + Surge back to his main head once this happens.

Note: When interacting with the artefacts, you're left unable to act until the animation is finished. Equipping your Bladed Dive (or using it to get there) before you activate them is ideal. Room 2 (Bridge) \u2b25 Target the Necromancer with a stalled Corruption Shot + Vulnerability Bomb release with a 9sq weapon from this square move back \u2192 Bombardment then back in to stack the Horrors and the Necromancer for a .

It's easier to triple Bladed Dive for this line instead, it'll just be slightly slower as demonstrated below. Faster form Triple BD - Easier form Note: Judge accordingly if you have (or want) to do a full clear to bank comfortably, with enough speed the Zombie(s) and / or Sotapanna(s) will not reach you in time. Taraket the Necromancer This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket, Corpses and Skeletons are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet , Undead Slayer perk and sigil purposes. Mechanics \u2b25 Rift of Undeath - \u200e \u200eThis Rift with 30k HP will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode for heavy typeless damage to the player. Prevented by killing it. \u2b25 Death's Swiftness - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones. \u2b25 Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs until its death. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's auto-attacks. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket. \u2b25 Spirit Line - Taraket smashes the ground infront of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits infront of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Move out of the way as needed be. Strategy The use of Chins gives Ranged an unique distinction for rapid, yet somewhat safe kills at Taraket. It is paramount you properly flick Soul Split and keep a good amount of damage up to sustain yourself through both corpses. Remember to equip your Salve Amulet after using your Essence of Finalities . \u2b25 Opener \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 Dazing Shot \u2192 Split Soul \u2192 GRico \u2192 Rapid Fire \u2192 Snap Shot \u2192 Needle \u2192 GRico \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Roughly at 200k move him to the Carrier Crystal with Rout / Demoralize \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dark Bow to phase him quickly if needed be. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 GRico on the portal with Hydrix to recover adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Blocking his path to the Carrier crystal makes the kill faster, at a significant cost of safety. Doing this wil require you to Bladed Dive right next to Taraket upon reaching phase HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you achieved a Portal Skip, save GRico for the Corpse Carrier and his skeletons. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Carrier can be flanked with your first ability by using target cycle. \u2b25 Corpse Carrier: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you have time (via a Portal Skip) on the Corpse Carrier until Taraket is vulnerable again. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stand on the spot that Taraket will land to avoid using Rout / Demoralize on him. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Lure them so they can be 'd together while camping Soul Split . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Carrier can be flanked with your first ability by using target cycle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Rout / Demoralize Taraket to move him next to the Portal you didn't stand on the previously mentioned spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you have an Eldritch Crossbow in your Essence of Finality , you may Split Soul here with Chins . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Rush to 200K HP as fast as possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The remaining skeletons will be finished off with as the fight progresses. \u2b25 Bloated Monstrosity: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prepare your Death's Swiftness a few seconds before he's vulnerable again, giving you time to build up as much adrenaline as possible \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Split Soul + Undead Sigil \u2192 GRico \u2192 Rapid Fire \u2192 Snap Shot \u2192 Needle \u2192 GRico \u200e \u200e \u2192 Improvise until the end of the kill. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stay MD of him at all times.

It covers basic money making, early combat training, and short skilling guides. Initial Goals Things to Aim For When Starting Out This section lists the recommended skill levels to get before getting started with bossing. None of these are strictly necessary, although advised in order to traverse a smooth path throughout the PvM learning curve. \u2b25 Level 90+ in the desired combat style \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Getting atleast 90 in the desired combat style is heavily recommended to ensure decent hitchance, damage, and survivability at most bosses. \u2b25 Level 70 Prayer \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This unlocks prayers which boost DPS by 8%, which are deeply helpful and easy to unlock. \u2b25 Level 89 Herblore \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This unlocks adrenaline potions and the possibility of boosting your level by +7 using pulse cores in order to access overloads. These two are extremely useful in almost all PvM scenarios. \u2b25 Level 77 Summoning \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This unlocks the Talon Beast familiar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Although heavily recommended getting to 96 ASAP, having a somewhat decent DPS familiar and a BoB (War Tortoise at 67) will be extremely helpful. \u2b25 Unlocking and getting level 68 in Invention \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This opens the possibility of boosting your level by +7 using an Extreme Invention potion in order to access Ancient Invention. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, it is recommended to get higher levels before attempting optimal gizmos. Money Making The purpose of this section is to explain some methods with which you can make money to start buying gear as a low level player. \u2b25 Assumes no main account. \u2b25 If main account exists to transfer gp/purchase bonds, skip this section. Vis Wax Requires: 50 Runecrafting \u2b25 Located in the Runecrafting Guild, you may activate this machine once per day and choose 3 runes to obtain up to 100 vis wax. \u2b25 The first rune is identical for everyone; the second rune is chosen at random between 3 runes; the third rune is random (Runecrafting skill cape perk reveals this rune). Note: It is recommended to use cheap runes to obtain vis wax. Try to use any of the following: air, mind, earth, water, fire, body, chaos, death. Avoid combination runes at all costs. Skilling Methods \u2b25 Smithing Steel Bars \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do the quest The Knights Sword to get the required Smithing level. \u2b25 Making headless arrows \u2b25 Archaeology: Harvesting cache materials Other \u2b25 Completing easy clues \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They require almost no stats, yet can reward you with Fortunate Component-giving items worth ~800k-1m each. It is recommended to get at least 50 Thieving and 40 Agility should you plan to pickpocket H.A.M members for clues, however they are not required. \u2b25 Collecting Zamorak mjolnirs \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This method can net upwards of 4m/hr and has very little requirements. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 See this guide: https://runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Finding_Zamorak_mjolnirs . Combat Training The purpose of this section is to break down, as simply as possible, some relatively efficient means of getting the combat stats required to begin bossing. Notes: \u2b25 You do not have to strictly follow this should your budget not allow you to do so. \u2b25 Acquiring a charming imp as early as possible will save you a lot of hassle, however it is not required. If you wish to do that, then you should do the Elite Dungeons 1 token farming method. You can find a server dedicated to this in #unknown-channel (EDTeams) or #unknown-channel . \u2b25 Constitution and Defence are not listed as they can be passively trained alongside the other combat styles. \u2b25 While not mentioned, you should always upgrade to the highest tier weapon and then power armour that you can afford when training. \u2b25 For melee specifically, a halberd range weapon is strongly recommended. You have 2 main options when it comes to training combat skills: Elite Dungeon 3 trash runs and Slayer. Elite Dungeons ED3 trash runs offer the highest combat experience rates in the game as well as relatively good gp/h. It is recommended to have some decently leveled gear (level 50+ in a trio should be fine), since exp gained is based on damage dealt. Find teams to do this with in the servers mentioned alongside the charming imp above. The two most common methods are: \u2b25 Elite Dungeons 3: all mobs till the first pack of zombies \u2b25 Elite Dungeons 1: first floor minibosses (farming Dungeoneering tokens) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly recommended to have at least one experienced player in your group for the ED1 method, as the bosses can be quite dangerous. The ED3 method is more beginner friendly. Slayer Your second option is Slayer. While this offers less combat exp and gp/hr than EDs in the early levels, it comes with the benefit of leveling up a very lucrative skill in the future. It also provides a lot of charms for Summoning. A good way to train low level Slayer is crushing the corrupted scarabs that spawn in and around Menaphos. For more information: https://runescape.wiki/w/Corrupted_Scarab_(Menaphos) \u2b25 Your number one priority for Slayer is to complete the Smoking Kills . This quest will double all your Slayer point rewards from completing tasks. \u2b25 After that you should focus on obtaining a Full Slayer Helmet. This helm gives a large accuracy and damage boost against monsters you have a task for. The following are methods to train if you do not wish to do either Slayer or Elite Dungeons. They are split up by style. Attack and Strength \u2b25 Note: The Grand Tree quest gives a 18,750 experience lamp that you can use on either Ranged, Strength, Attack, Defence, Constitution or Magic.

Note: It is recommended to use cheap runes to obtain vis wax. Try to use any of the following: air, mind, earth, water, fire, body, chaos, death. Avoid combination runes at all costs. Skilling Methods \u2b25 Smithing Steel Bars \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do the quest The Knights Sword to get the required Smithing level. \u2b25 Making headless arrows \u2b25 Archaeology: Harvesting cache materials Other \u2b25 Completing easy clues \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They require almost no stats, yet can reward you with Fortunate Component-giving items worth ~800k-1m each.

Notes: \u2b25 You do not have to strictly follow this should your budget not allow you to do so. \u2b25 Acquiring a charming imp as early as possible will save you a lot of hassle, however it is not required. If you wish to do that, then you should do the Elite Dungeons 1 token farming method. You can find a server dedicated to this in #unknown-channel (EDTeams) or #unknown-channel . \u2b25 Constitution and Defence are not listed as they can be passively trained alongside the other combat styles. \u2b25 While not mentioned, you should always upgrade to the highest tier weapon and then power armour that you can afford when training. \u2b25 For melee specifically, a halberd range weapon is strongly recommended. You have 2 main options when it comes to training combat skills: Elite Dungeon 3 trash runs and Slayer. Elite Dungeons ED3 trash runs offer the highest combat experience rates in the game as well as relatively good gp/h. It is recommended to have some decently leveled gear (level 50+ in a trio should be fine), since exp gained is based on damage dealt. Find teams to do this with in the servers mentioned alongside the charming imp above. The two most common methods are: \u2b25 Elite Dungeons 3: all mobs till the first pack of zombies \u2b25 Elite Dungeons 1: first floor minibosses (farming Dungeoneering tokens) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly recommended to have at least one experienced player in your group for the ED1 method, as the bosses can be quite dangerous. The ED3 method is more beginner friendly. Slayer Your second option is Slayer. While this offers less combat exp and gp/hr than EDs in the early levels, it comes with the benefit of leveling up a very lucrative skill in the future. It also provides a lot of charms for Summoning. A good way to train low level Slayer is crushing the corrupted scarabs that spawn in and around Menaphos. For more information: https://runescape.wiki/w/Corrupted_Scarab_(Menaphos) \u2b25 Your number one priority for Slayer is to complete the Smoking Kills . This quest will double all your Slayer point rewards from completing tasks. \u2b25 After that you should focus on obtaining a Full Slayer Helmet. This helm gives a large accuracy and damage boost against monsters you have a task for. The following are methods to train if you do not wish to do either Slayer or Elite Dungeons. They are split up by style. Attack and Strength \u2b25 Note: The Grand Tree quest gives a 18,750 experience lamp that you can use on either Ranged, Strength, Attack, Defence, Constitution or Magic.

There are three modes to revolution: only basics (revo), basics and thresholds (revo+), or basics, thresholds and ultimates (revo++). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For a player just getting into PvM, it is perfectly fine to use revolution. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There are helpful guides and ability bar set ups on the official RS Wiki that make Revolution viable in combat. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For most combat situations and scenarios, Revolution is OK enough. \u2b25 Full manual is a combat mode where the game does not activate any abilities for you. Every ability you want to use in combat will require an input from the player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With no inputs from the player, full manual will only use auto attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Full manual offers more control over what abilities are used, when they are used, and how they are used. Why You Should Switch to Full Manual A Comparison Between Revolution and Full Manual \u2b25 Channeled abilities \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Usually last longer than a Global Cooldown (3 ticks or 1.8s). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Have an extra delay between the last hit of the ability and the start of the next ability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This delay can be negated by manually inputting the next ability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Revolution will let the delay run its course, which wastes time and damage. \u2b25 Below is a comparison of manually canceling a channeled ability vs just letting revo do it for you. The player in the top version will let revo cancel Snipe for them, with no manual input at all. The player in the bottom version will manually cancel the Snipe ability to initiate the next ability quicker. Notice how long the top player just stands idle after Snipe. https://i.imgur.com/6uH4KVg.gifv Note: Manually canceling channeled abilities can be done on Revolution mode. But, it still requires a manual input from the player with precise timing. \u2b25 Ultimate abilities \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Should normally be used manually even if using Revolution (except afk slayer). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Good Revolution bars will have the stronger abilities towards the beginning of the revo bar so they get activated more frequently. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is good for general usage but detrimental for damage boosting ultimates like Sunshine , Death's Swiftness and Berzerk . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The best abilities will likely be on cooldown at the start of your damage boosting ult due to being at the front of the revo bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Some of the best abilities are bleeds which will be near the front of the revo bar, but bleeds are NOT boosted by damage boosting ultimates. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Full manual benefits a lot in damage boosting ultimates because you have full control of when you use the strong abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Strong abilities can be saved until you are within the damage boosting ultimate to get more out of them. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bleed usage can be easily avoided in damage boosting ultimates since you can just choose to not input any bleed abilities. \u2b25 The gif below will demonstrate how Revolution can make someone use bad abilities in a damage boosting ultimate. Take a look at what abilities were used right after sunshine: https://i.imgur.com/Y6XWNaF.jpg \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using Full Manual, this person would have been able to plan out what abilities are used prior to activating Sunshine . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- They can choose to use bleeds such as Corruption Blast or Combust , or they can choose to use a weaker ability such as Tuska\u2019s Wrath right before Sunshine to make sure the good abilities like Dragon Breath and Impact (Flanking ) are off cooldown and ready to use in Sunshine . Boss Mechanics \u2b25 As you progress in PvM and face tougher and tougher bosses, you will encounter bosses with mechanics where revolution could greatly hinder your combat ability. Here are a few scenarios where revolution could cause more harm than good: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- During his web shield, the player must manually input to stop attacking, otherwise all damage dealt gets reflected onto the player, potentially causing a KO \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- During his reflect, damage gets reflected onto a player and Revo requires a manual input for the player to stop attacking \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For \"Hold Still, Invader\", you switch to a shield and use Resonance . This does require precise timing and if you are not on FM, there is a chance that Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance , activating GCD which will ruin your timing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Kalphite King: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- During his green attack, you're required to provoke KK, then use either Devotion or Resonance to negate damage/heal from the large hit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Nex: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Any attacks during Blood Siphon will heal Nex rather than hurt her, requiring manual input to prevent Revolution from attacking her. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- During Blood Phase, Nex heals from bleeds, requiring manual input to avoid using bleeds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Helwyr: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For his swipe attack, a common strategy to deal with it is to Resonance it to heal some health back. This does require precise timing and if you are not on FM, there is a chance that Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance , activating GCD which will ruin your timing. \u2b25 Revo with mostly manual inputs \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is not much difference between using Full Manual without Revolution, versus Full Manual with Revolution as a backup. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The biggest difference between the two is without revo, you have insurance that you will never use an ability that you didn't mean to use. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Auto attacks do not work well with Revolution. For example with Magic if you wish to utilize 4TAA, you need to input the auto attack once to cancel your next revo input. and again to actually fire the auto attack. \u2b25 5 tick auto attack (5TAA) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee and Ranged cannot utilize 5TAA because there is no \"auto\" button like Magic has with casting a spell to stop the next ability from happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 5TAA can normally be used instead of a weaker ability if the better abilities happen to be on cooldown at the same time. How to Transition from Revolution to Full Manual Step by step \u2b25 Set good keybinds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is very important to have keybinds that are comfortable to reach and make sense to you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is up to the user to decide what keybinds make sense to them. \u2b25 Practice the keybinds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Spend time at combat dummies just getting used to the keybinds, and commit them to muscle memory. Your goal is to not need to think about what keybind does what ability. You should know what ability you want to do, and the muscle memory should do the rest for you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Another good place to practice is God Wars Dungeon 2 due to how it has low death potential and can earn you some money as you practice the new keybinds. \u2b25 Gradual transition, or fully commit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Some players find it easier to start easing into full manual by keeping revo active as a backup, but using more and more manual inputs until they feel confident enough to turn revo off. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Some players find it easer to rip the band aid off and just turn off revo, then practice their keybinds over and over until they are confident enough to use full manual in real PvM scenarios. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Again, it is up to the user to decide what works best for them.

Into the Spider's Den \u2b25 He can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base enrage values is used. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This includes minion spawns and its strength in general. \u2b25 The fight is heavily influenced by the player's choice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path opens. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day. \u2b25 Despite displaying a \"None\" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players carrying an Araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Simply creating an instance has the same effect as bringing a pheromone as well. Note: It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from Player Owned Farms; it may be obtained by keeping any elder spider along with a farm totem in both medium paddocks. Profits Each kill of Araxxor with melee is worth 2,663,663. Advanced players can get up to 17 kph average across all paths, earning on average 45,282,267 gp/hr. Drops His drops include components for three level 90 two-handed weapons, one for each combat style, along with a pet, with multiple skins to be unlocked for the pet through achievements. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Pheromone : 1/(50-[Enrage/20]) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Leg piece : 1/40 (1/70 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Hilt : 1/120 \u200e \u200e(1/200 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Araxyte egg : 1/500 (200 threshold) Note: It is recommended to avoid using Mage at Araxxor because it spawns the melee form of Araxxor which applies a typeless bleed to the player. Presets Beginner Preset \u2b25 Stay at halberd range (2 squares) so as to not receive melee auto attacks, and DPS away. \u2b25 A Scrimshaw of Vampyrism will also help you keep your life points high. \u2b25 Bring some form of poison prevention, as the range version of Araxxor will repeatedly poison you and reduce the antipoison timer. Intermediate Preset \u2b25 Stay at halberd range (2 squares) so as to not receive melee auto attacks, and DPS away. \u2b25 A Scrimshaw of Vampyrism will also help you keep your life points high. \u2b25 Bring some form of poison prevention, as the range version or Araxxor will repeatedly poison you and reduce the antipoison timer. \u2b25 Once food is easier to conserve, switch from a Pack mammoth to a Nihil, Ripper demon , or Kal'gerion Demon. \u2b25 As a meleer, Berserker aura should be used when possible, and your highest tier Brawler aura otherwise. Experienced Preset \u2b25 Once more seasoned at the boss, it is recommended to start incorporating a DW/2H switching rotation for more DPS output. \u2b25 A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the P4 transition. \u2b25 If you want more consistency on killing each phase faster, use the Grimoire for Phases 2/3/4. \u2b25 If you want more efficient gp/hr, use Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . \u2b25 Jellies are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sailfish and Saradomin brew can be used for panic eating. \u2b25 A Noxious Scythe can be brought for helping to AoE minions that may spawn when Path 1 is open, as well as to stay safe outside of melee distance on higher enrages as needed. \u2b25 Zaros godsword and Seren godbow are brought for their respective special attacks. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Mechanics \u2b25 Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Mage auto-attack Ranged auto-attack Melee auto-attack \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally, this should be prepared for by using Anticipate or Freedom before the 5th auto attack \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- While either of these abilities are up, the player will not pulled in by the cleave and the cocoon special attack will not last as long. \u2b25 Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if Araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave. Cleave \u2b25 Araxxor pulls you in and hits the player with a large typeless hit unless the player can get out of the attack range. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The player will always need to run away a few tiles to avoid this. Cocoon \u2b25 Araxxor Wraps the player in a cocoon, causing them to take damage every tick until they escape. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To escape, simply spam click. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The duration of being wrapped up is greatly reduced if the player has Anticipate or Freedom active before this special attack comes. Web Shield \u2b25 Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. \u2b25 This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This special attack can be used to gain some health back by using on your own hit, \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to use Quake since it hits slow enough for you to equip a shield and catch the Resonance . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Be wary of Crackling and Aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back. Minion Spawn \u2b25 Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly. \u2b25 When path 1 is open, this special attack can occur on Phase 3/4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 if Path 1 was taken, minions can also be spawned on Phase 2 \u2b25 Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a Mirrorback or Pulsing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the first wave, it's the third to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the second wave, it's the second to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the third wave, it's the first to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is no special spider in the fourth wave. Egg Bomb \u2b25 Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs and fire a slow moving projectile at you. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will take 300 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 2 eggs are exploded, the player will take 1200 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 1 egg is exploded, the player will take 2100 damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 0 eggs are exploded, the player will take 3000 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider \u2b25 Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. \u2b25 The Acid Spider will start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 when it fills up fully, the spider will explode and you will be safe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 its speed is variable. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To deal with this, you can either: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Barricade or Immortality to negate the damage from the spider. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bladed Dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Run away or dodge it if you have room to do so. Acid Spiders \u2b25 On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn Acid Spiders. These can be lured into Araxxor to reduce the enrage of the boss. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To do this, click on them and lure them beneath Araxxor. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is better to just ignore these spiders. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots \u2b25 The Room will go dark and there will be a lit up spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages. Overview of the Fight Phase 1 \u2b25 Choose which path you want to open up by clicking on the web blocking it at the start of the fight. The web will burn for 1 minute. \u2b25 Araxxor can do 3 different special attacks this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cleave \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cocoon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Web Shield \u2b25 Araxxor cannot be killed. He will revive to 5,000 HP whenever he goes down to 0HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you get Araxxor to <5,000 HP before the web burns, you can choose to do some set ups for phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing top path, you can Natural Instinct so you won't need to use an adrenaline potion for phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing middle path, you can work on stacking Storm Shards for later in the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing bottom path, there is no setup that can make it faster. Phase 2 \u2b25 Top Path \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor can do 5 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Egg Bomb (always the first mechanic on Phase 2) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Minion Spawn \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cleave \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cocoon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Web Shield \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to simply do damage while being mindful of special attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Utilizing Greater Barge can help with burst damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can go directly from phase 2 to phase 3 whenever you want by running down the hallway. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to go from phase 2 to phase 3 sometime after the Egg Bomb special attack, but before the next special attack so minion spawns don't get lost when you start going towards phase 3. \u2b25 Middle Path \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor can do 4 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Egg Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Instakill Spider \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cleave \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Web Shield \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to lure Araxxor into the large acid pool, let him absorb enough acid, and then drag him up the platform until he starts burning it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxor needs to have absorbed at least 55% acid to ensure he fully burns the platform and opens up phase 3. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxor checks to see if he is standing in the acid every 10 ticks (6 seconds) before starting to absorb it. There is a setup guide for this down in the advanced section for Middle Path which can save 6 seconds in a kill. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- When the platform has burned about 30%, you can Natural Instinct to help gain more adrenaline in phase 3. \u2b25 Bottom Path \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor can do 2 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Light Spots (constantly active on this phase) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Egg Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to chase the light spots around the hallway to avoid damage while waiting for Araxxor to charge at you, causing a cutscene and prompting you to dodge it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you dodge the charge, the wall breaks and phase 3 opens up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you fail to dodge the charge, you will take damage and need to wait for another charge. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The following infographic shows all four possible movements. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly recommended to bring Bladed Dive and a piece of gear with a Mobile perk for better mobility. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can conserve food by using Resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Note: You can use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An Adrenaline urn or the Persistent Rage Phase 3 \u2b25 All Paths \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 3 starts when you enter the back end of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor will heal up to 80% of the leftover health he had from phase 1 and 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor's attack speed increases on this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor does different mechanics depending on which paths are open. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxor can do any special attack from both of the currently open paths. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxor. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Generally it is best do a Berserk rotation to finish the phase ASAP. Phase 4 \u2b25 All Paths \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 4 starts after you kill Araxxor in phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- There will be a cutscene and Araxxi will be the enemy of the last phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxi. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxi Can do 3 different mechanics while she is above 50k hp (no special attacks happen below 50k hp). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cleave \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cocoon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Web Shield \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxi can fight with all 3 combat styles. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If player is in melee distance, Araxxi will use Melee or Magic attacks at random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If player is not in melee distance, Araxxi will use Ranged or Magic attacks, whichever the player is currently NOT praying against at the time of attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 From 50k to 25k hp, Araxxi hits harder and faster, and takes reduced damage from the player \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 25k hp, Araxxi drains your adrenaline by 50% and summons an acid core that bounces around the arena. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxi takes full damage again once reaching 25k hp. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The acid core will deal high damage if it touches the player. If it does this, move one tile to make it start bouncing around again. Note: You can save a good threshold to use just above 25k hp before you get adrenaline drained and kill Araxxi before the acid core ever has a chance to touch you. Note: At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection, as seen in this video: https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc Phase 4 Tips and Tricks Gaining Adrenaline and Lossless Eating/Devotion \u2b25 At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can then wait 10 seconds to drop combat stance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This allows you to use Devotion without losing 15% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also allows you to eat solid foods without losing 10% adrenaline per bite. Standing in Scythe Distance \u2b25 In order to take advantage of the 2 tile range of halberds you must stand out of melee distance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Here is an image you can use as a visual guide to find the proper \"scythe distance\" on phase 4: \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 And following is a clip for better visual representation: https://youtu.be/daiPvzj7J40 Advanced Guide Top path \u2b25 Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This phase is timegated so it can be used to set yourself up for phase 2 while you deal damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Use Quake and build adrenaline so you are ready to Natural Instinct when the web burn reaches 50-55%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Build adrenaline to 90%+ and use a dragon battleaxe special attack . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Build adrenaline again and use a Zaros Godsword special attack at ~80% web burn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Build adrenaline one more time, stop attacking around 92% web burn and run to the web. finish building adrenaline with defensives if you need. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase into phase 2 asap. \u2b25 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Immediately with the Mobile perk \u2192 . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The rest of Phase 2 depends on when Araxxor uses a special attack (it will always be Egg Bomb). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Abandon the rotation and start running to phase 3 no matter how far in you were when the Egg Bomb special attack happens. maximizing time before a special attack is more important than doing extra damage on phase 2. Use \u2192 \u2192 to get to phase 3 quickly \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Optional: Use a Powerburst of Acceleration when Araxxor does the Egg Bomb spec to get to phase 3 even faster. To do this you will do \u2192 \u2192 (the last Surge should take you into phase 3, and then you can use the last Bladed Dive to get closer to rax back in the Phase 2 tunnel). This can save a couple seconds of time during the run from phase 1 area to phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build to 100% adren with defensives while running to phase 3. You'll want to Berserk a couple seconds before you reach phase 3 so you can build some extra adrenaline for phase 3. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You want to turn around in phase 3 as soon as you enter, so it is good to learn where phase 2 ends and where phase 3 begins. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Crossing the yellow line in this picture will start phase 3. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once you start phase 3, run back towards rax and follow this rotation: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (2 hit) \u2192 \u2192 Middle path \u2b25 Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Remember to stack Storm Shards with \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You should try to apply a Shard at the very start and every time as soon as it comes off cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Walk Araxxor so he is right against the web (see below about how to walk phase 1). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Below is a diagram to help with positioning Araxxor on P1 (Camera facing east): \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The yellow line is the line to stand on after walking Araxxor, if you move 1 more square east, Araxxor will run into the web and start going west again which could ruin the setup. If you have trouble finding this spot just keep in mind you must stand 1 east of the line where the skulls are (circled in red). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 99% web burn you can Bladed Dive + Surge into phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You'll know if you did it correctly if Araxxor starts absorbing the acid at 1:06 rather than the standard 1:12. This can be delayed if Araxxor does a special attack right before the web finishes burning. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Here is a video example on walking Araxxor in phase 1: https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k \u2b25 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run across the acid pool and stall a Shard . Run up 3 tiles onto the platform. This puts rax as far up the path as he can be while still absorbing acid. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Below is a picture of how far up the ramp to stand for this lure: \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deal damage and remember to keep applying with . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When Araxxor has absorbed 53% acid, you can up the platform, then walk 1 tile west so you have room behind you to dodge Cleave special attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You'll know you timed this correctly if Araxxor's acid absorption goes up to 55% then starts dropping, and you'll get the popup message that the bridge is burning when there is 49% acid left. This is the perfect amount needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Set up for phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Natural instinct timing is calculated based on how much acid Araxxor has poured onto the bridge. The timing is roughly when the bridge has absorbed 25-30% acid. Under normal circumstances, this means the popup would appear at 49%, so you would when the bar says 24-19%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 build to 100% and prepare for phase 3. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 as you are jumping down the ramp \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 How to losslessly get 5 Storm Shards on Araxxor before Phase 3 \u2b25 Phase 1: 2 shards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Storm Shard on Araxxor as your first ability on phase 1 when he becomes attackable, and use another as soon as it is off cooldown about halfway through phase 1. \u2b25 Phase 2: 3 shards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Bladed Dive to get across the pool in phase 2 and stall a 3rd Storm Shard on Araxxor by using the ability out of range and clicking under you. Don't use any other abilities or you will lose the stalled shard. Once Araxxor starts absorbing acid you can click on him to release the stalled Storm Shard . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stalling the storm shard like this gets the cooldown timer ticking sooner so you can use another 2 shards losslessly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply the 4th Storm Shard just before you run up the platform when Araxxor has absorbed enough acid to burn the bridge (~53%) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use the 5th Storm Shard while waiting for the bridge to burn. Bottom path \u2b25 Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No special setup. Just dps araxxor down to <5k hp \u2b25 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No special setup. Follow the light and wait for the charge. stay at 100% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the charge you can do a defensive ability to stay in combat, then while running towards phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You can start running towards phase 3 during the cutscene after you dodge the charge. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Phase 4 \u2b25 This is the same regardless of which path you took. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Spam a defensive or non-Mobile surge to gain adren when the cutscene ends and drop a dummy. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build adrenaline until Araxxi jumps onto araxxor, then stop attacking the dummy and build with defensives so you can charge Greater Barge . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Right after Araxxi raises and drops her front legs, the dummy with dual wield and to Araxxi and equip . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 click or target cycle to Araxxi and use a Zaros Godsword special attack 2H auto \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cancel after 2 or 3 hits depending on Araxxi's hp.

The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will take 300 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 2 eggs are exploded, the player will take 1200 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 1 egg is exploded, the player will take 2100 damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 0 eggs are exploded, the player will take 3000 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider \u2b25 Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. \u2b25 The Acid Spider will start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 when it fills up fully, the spider will explode and you will be safe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 its speed is variable. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To deal with this, you can either: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Barricade or Immortality to negate the damage from the spider. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bladed Dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Run away or dodge it if you have room to do so. Acid Spiders \u2b25 On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn Acid Spiders. These can be lured into Araxxor to reduce the enrage of the boss. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To do this, click on them and lure them beneath Araxxor. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is better to just ignore these spiders. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots \u2b25 The Room will go dark and there will be a lit up spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-melee/#overview-of-the-fight","text":"Phase 1 \u2b25 Choose which path you want to open up by clicking on the web blocking it at the start of the fight.

There is a setup guide for this down in the advanced section for Middle Path which can save 6 seconds in a kill. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- When the platform has burned about 30%, you can Natural Instinct to help gain more adrenaline in phase 3. \u2b25 Bottom Path \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor can do 2 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Light Spots (constantly active on this phase) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Egg Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to chase the light spots around the hallway to avoid damage while waiting for Araxxor to charge at you, causing a cutscene and prompting you to dodge it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you dodge the charge, the wall breaks and phase 3 opens up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you fail to dodge the charge, you will take damage and need to wait for another charge. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The following infographic shows all four possible movements. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly recommended to bring Bladed Dive and a piece of gear with a Mobile perk for better mobility. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can conserve food by using Resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Note: You can use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An Adrenaline urn or the Persistent Rage Phase 3 \u2b25 All Paths \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 3 starts when you enter the back end of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor will heal up to 80% of the leftover health he had from phase 1 and 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor's attack speed increases on this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor does different mechanics depending on which paths are open. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxor can do any special attack from both of the currently open paths. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxor. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Generally it is best do a Berserk rotation to finish the phase ASAP. Phase 4 \u2b25 All Paths \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 4 starts after you kill Araxxor in phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- There will be a cutscene and Araxxi will be the enemy of the last phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxi. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxi Can do 3 different mechanics while she is above 50k hp (no special attacks happen below 50k hp). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cleave \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cocoon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Web Shield \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxi can fight with all 3 combat styles. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If player is in melee distance, Araxxi will use Melee or Magic attacks at random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If player is not in melee distance, Araxxi will use Ranged or Magic attacks, whichever the player is currently NOT praying against at the time of attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 From 50k to 25k hp, Araxxi hits harder and faster, and takes reduced damage from the player \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 25k hp, Araxxi drains your adrenaline by 50% and summons an acid core that bounces around the arena. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxi takes full damage again once reaching 25k hp. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The acid core will deal high damage if it touches the player. If it does this, move one tile to make it start bouncing around again. Note: You can save a good threshold to use just above 25k hp before you get adrenaline drained and kill Araxxi before the acid core ever has a chance to touch you. Note: At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection, as seen in this video: https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc","title":"Overview of the Fight"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-melee/#phase-4-tips-and-tricks","text":"Gaining Adrenaline and Lossless Eating/Devotion \u2b25 At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can then wait 10 seconds to drop combat stance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This allows you to use Devotion without losing 15% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also allows you to eat solid foods without losing 10% adrenaline per bite.

Use \u2192 \u2192 to get to phase 3 quickly \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Optional: Use a Powerburst of Acceleration when Araxxor does the Egg Bomb spec to get to phase 3 even faster. To do this you will do \u2192 \u2192 (the last Surge should take you into phase 3, and then you can use the last Bladed Dive to get closer to rax back in the Phase 2 tunnel). This can save a couple seconds of time during the run from phase 1 area to phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build to 100% adren with defensives while running to phase 3.

If you have trouble finding this spot just keep in mind you must stand 1 east of the line where the skulls are (circled in red). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 99% web burn you can Bladed Dive + Surge into phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You'll know if you did it correctly if Araxxor starts absorbing the acid at 1:06 rather than the standard 1:12. This can be delayed if Araxxor does a special attack right before the web finishes burning. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Here is a video example on walking Araxxor in phase 1: https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k \u2b25 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run across the acid pool and stall a Shard .

The timing is roughly when the bridge has absorbed 25-30% acid. Under normal circumstances, this means the popup would appear at 49%, so you would when the bar says 24-19%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 build to 100% and prepare for phase 3. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 as you are jumping down the ramp \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 How to losslessly get 5 Storm Shards on Araxxor before Phase 3 \u2b25 Phase 1: 2 shards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Storm Shard on Araxxor as your first ability on phase 1 when he becomes attackable, and use another as soon as it is off cooldown about halfway through phase 1. \u2b25 Phase 2: 3 shards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Bladed Dive to get across the pool in phase 2 and stall a 3rd Storm Shard on Araxxor by using the ability out of range and clicking under you. Don't use any other abilities or you will lose the stalled shard. Once Araxxor starts absorbing acid you can click on him to release the stalled Storm Shard . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stalling the storm shard like this gets the cooldown timer ticking sooner so you can use another 2 shards losslessly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply the 4th Storm Shard just before you run up the platform when Araxxor has absorbed enough acid to burn the bridge (~53%) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use the 5th Storm Shard while waiting for the bridge to burn.

Into the Spider's Den \u2b25 Araxxor can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base enrage values is used. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This includes minion spawns and its strength in general. \u2b25 The fight is heavily influenced by the player's choice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path opens. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day. \u2b25 Despite displaying a \"None\" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players carrying an Araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an Araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Simply creating an instance has the same effect as bringing a pheromone as well. Note: It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from Player Owned Farms; it may be obtained by keeping any elder spider along with a farm totem in both medium paddocks. Profits Each kill of Araxxor with range is worth 2,684,621. Advanced players can get up to 17 kph average across all paths, earning on average 45,638,554 gp/hr. Drops His drops include components for three level 90 two-handed weapons, one for each combat style, along with a pet, with multiple skins to be unlocked for the pet through achievements. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Pheromone : 1/(50-[Enrage/20]) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Leg piece : 1/40 (1/70 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Hilt : 1/120 \u200e \u200e(1/200 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Araxyte egg : 1/500 (200 threshold) Note: It is recommended to avoid using Mage at Araxxor because it spawns the melee form of Araxxor which applies a typeless bleed to the player. Presets Beginner Preset \u2b25 As a beginner, ranged will allow to you keep your distance from Araxxor making it easier to dodge Cleaves and melee hits. \u2b25 If you struggle with food management you may use a Yak, eventually upgrading to using a Nihil / Ripper Demon / Kal'gerion Demon. \u2b25 The bolts equipped are Ruby Bakriminel Bolts (e) , but can be replaced with Dragonstone or Onyx variants of Bakriminel bolts. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Incorporating bolt switches can improve your damage output \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, Hydrix Bakriminel Bolts (e) can help you get extra adrenaline if needed \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Ruby bolts become less effective the lower the enemies health is, so it is better to swap to a different bolt whenever Araxxor falls below 50k HP. As with most bosses, it is strongly recommended to use Reckless , or your highest tier Sharpshooter if Reckless is not available Experienced Preset \u2b25 Necessary items: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Eldritch Crossbow \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Essence of Finality - Seren Godbow special attack stored \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Limitless ability \u2b25 Relics: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 / Heightened Senses / Berserkers Fury \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Fury of the Small \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Death Ward \u2b25 A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the Phase 4 transition. \u2b25 If you want smoother phases, use Erethdor's Grimoire , if you want cheaper pocket slot usage that's still good, use Scrimshaw of Cruelty . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If choosing to use a Grimoire it is mainly beneficial to use during phase 2, 3, and 4. \u2b25 Jellyfish are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. \u2b25 Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Mechanics \u2b25 Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Mage auto-attack Ranged auto-attack Melee auto-attack \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally, this should be prepared for by using Anticipate or Freedom before the 5th auto attack \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- While either of these abilities are up, the player will not pulled in by the cleave and the cocoon special attack will not last as long. \u2b25 Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if Araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave. Cleave \u2b25 Araxxor pulls you in and hits the player with a large typeless hit unless the player can get out of the attack range. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The player can simply stand at a distance and use Anticipate or Freedom to avoid being dragged in. Cocoon \u2b25 Araxxor Wraps the player in a cocoon, causing them to take damage every tick until they escape. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To escape, simply spam click. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The duration of being wrapped up is greatly reduced if the player has Anticipate or Freedom active before this special attack comes. Web Shield \u2b25 Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. \u2b25 This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This special attack can be used to gain some health back by using on your own hit, \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to use Snipe for the same reason. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Be wary of Crackling and Aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back. Minion Spawn \u2b25 Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly. \u2b25 When path 1 is open, this special attack can occur on Phase 3/4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 if Path 1 was taken, minions can also be spawned on Phase 2 \u2b25 Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a Mirrorback or Pulsing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the first wave, it's the third to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the second wave, it's the second to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the third wave, it's the first to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is no special spider in the fourth wave. Egg Bomb \u2b25 Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs and fire a slow moving projectile at you. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will take 300 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 2 eggs are exploded, the player will take 1200 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 1 egg is exploded, the player will take 2100 damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 0 eggs are exploded, the player will take 3000 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider \u2b25 Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. \u2b25 The Acid Spider will start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 when it fills up fully, the spider will explode and you will be safe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 its speed is variable. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To deal with this, you can either: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Barricade or Immortality to negate the damage from the spider. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bladed Dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Run away or dodge it if you have room to do so. Acid Spiders \u2b25 On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn Acid Spiders. These can be lured into Araxxor to reduce the enrage of the boss. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To do this, click on them and lure them beneath Araxxor. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is better to just ignore these spiders. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots \u2b25 The Room will go dark and there will be a lit up spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages. Overview of the Fight Phase 1 \u2b25 Choose which path you want to open up by clicking on the web blocking it at the start of the fight. The web will burn for 1 minute. \u2b25 Araxxor can do 3 different special attacks this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cleave \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cocoon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Web Shield \u2b25 Araxxor cannot be killed. He will revive to 5,000 HP whenever he goes down to 0HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you get Araxxor to <5,000 HP before the web burns, you can choose to do some set ups for phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing top path, you can Natural Instinct so you won't need to use an adrenaline potion for phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing middle path, you can work on stacking Storm Shards for later in the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If doing bottom path, there is no setup that can make it faster.

There is a setup guide for this down in the advanced section for Middle Path which can save 6 seconds in a kill. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- When the platform has burned about 30%, you can Natural Instinct to help gain more adrenaline in phase 3. \u2b25 Bottom Path \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor can do 2 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Light Spots (constantly active on this phase) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Egg Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to chase the light spots around the hallway to avoid damage while waiting for Araxxor to charge at you, causing a cutscene and prompting you to dodge it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you dodge the charge, the wall breaks and phase 3 opens up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you fail to dodge the charge, you will take damage and need to wait for another charge. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The following infographic shows all four possible movements. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly recommended to bring Bladed Dive and a piece of gear with a Mobile perk for better mobility. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can conserve food by using Resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Note: You can use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An Adrenaline urn or the Persistent Rage Phase 3 \u2b25 All Paths \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 3 starts when you enter the back end of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor will heal up to 80% of the leftover health he had from phase 1 and 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor's attack speed increases on this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxor does different mechanics depending on which paths are open. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxor can do any special attack from both of the currently open paths. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxor. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is best to finish the phase ASAP. Phase 4 \u2b25 All Paths \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phase 4 starts after you kill Araxxor in phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- There will be a cutscene and Araxxi will be the enemy of the last phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxi. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxi Can do 3 different mechanics while she is above 50k hp (no special attacks happen below 50k hp). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cleave \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Cocoon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Web Shield \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Araxxi can fight with all 3 combat styles. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If player is in melee distance, Araxxi will use Melee or Magic attacks at random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If player is not in melee distance, Araxxi will use Ranged or Magic attacks, whichever the player is currently NOT praying against at the time of attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 From 50k to 25k hp, Araxxi hits harder and faster, and takes reduced damage from the player \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 25k hp, Araxxi drains your adrenaline by 50% and summons an acid core that bounces around the arena. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxi takes full damage again once reaching 25k hp. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The acid core will deal high damage if it touches the player. If it does this, move one tile to make it start bouncing around again. Note: You can save a good threshold to use just above 25k hp before you get adrenaline drained and kill Araxxi before the acid core ever has a chance to touch you. Note: At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection, as seen in this video: https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc Phase 4 Tips and Tricks Gaining Adrenaline and Lossless Eating/Devotion \u2b25 At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can then wait 10 seconds to drop combat stance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This allows you to use Devotion without losing 15% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also allows you to eat solid foods without losing 10% adrenaline per bite.

Crossing the yellow line in this picture will start Phase 3. Since you run 2 tiles at a time you can click back towards phase 2 just before you cross the line and your character should still cross it. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run to the end of the hallway to start phase 3, then run back towards Araxxor. equip again. \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk under \u2192 \u2192 Middle Path \u2b25 Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Walk araxxor so he is right against the web (see below about how to walk p1) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 99% web burn you can bladed dive + surge into phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You'll know if you did it correctly if rax \u200e \u200estarts absorbing the acid at 1:06 rather than the standard 1:12. This can be delayed if rax does a spec right before the web finishes burning. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Below is a diagram to help with positioning Araxxor on P1 (Camera facing east) \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The yellow line is the line to stand on after walking Araxxor, if you move 1 more square east Araxxor will run into the web and start going west again which could ruin the setup. If you have trouble finding this spot just keep in mind you must stand 1 east of the line where the skulls are (circled in red). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Here is a video example on walking Araxxor in P1: https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k \u2b25 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run across the acid pool and 3 tiles onto the ramp. This puts rax as far up the path as he can be while still absorbing acid. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deal damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When rax has absorbed 53% acid, you can + up the ramp, then walk 1 tile west so you have room to dodge cleave specials at the top of the ramp. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You'll know you did this correctly if rax goes up to 55% then starts dropping, and you'll get the popup message that the bridge is burning when there is 49% acid left. This is the perfect amount needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Set up for phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Natural instinct timing is calculated based on how much acid rax has poured onto the bridge. The timing is roughly when the bridge has absorbed 25-30% acid. Under normal circumstances, this means the popup would appear at 49%, so you would natural instinct when the bar says 24-19%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build to 100% and prepare for p3. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start with \u2192 Auto + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk under \u2192 \u2192 Bottom Path \u2b25 Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No special setup.

Stay at 100% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When you dodge the charge and Araxxor damages the wall, you can click the minimap to start running into phase 3, and then right click Araxxor when he is going up into the ceiling so you can right click 'attack' instantly in phase 3. This is nice in case minions spawn during p2 to avoid target cycle targeting them instead of Araxxor. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start with while running into Phase 3 area \u2192 (TC to Araxxor) + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk under \u2192 \u2192 Phase 4 \u2b25 This is the same regardless of which path you took. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Spam a defensive or non-mobile surge to gain adren when cutscene ends and drop a dummy, build to 100% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 + , build with \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Equip Just before Araxxi becomes attackable, \u2192 auto + \u2192 \u2192 OR if low on adren \u2192 Improvise Alternative Top Path Strategy (Courtesy of #Piegood) The idea of this method is to solo skip phase 3. If that fails then you still have to help carry the damage to finish phase 3 the normal way. This method doesn't get average times as fast as the non-skip method mentioned above, but it has a way faster killtime potential due to being able to solo skip.

As with most bosses, it is strongly recommended to use Reckless , or your highest tier Sharpshooter if Reckless is not available Experienced Preset \u2b25 Necessary items: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Eldritch Crossbow \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Essence of Finality - Seren Godbow special attack stored \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Limitless ability \u2b25 Relics: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 / Heightened Senses / Berserkers Fury \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Fury of the Small \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Death Ward \u2b25 A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the Phase 4 transition. \u2b25 If you want smoother phases, use Erethdor's Grimoire , if you want cheaper pocket slot usage that's still good, use Scrimshaw of Cruelty . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If choosing to use a Grimoire it is mainly beneficial to use during phase 2, 3, and 4. \u2b25 Jellyfish are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. \u2b25 Rune Pouch (Runes for )","title":"Presets"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-range/#mechanics","text":"\u2b25 Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Mage auto-attack Ranged auto-attack Melee auto-attack \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally, this should be prepared for by using Anticipate or Freedom before the 5th auto attack \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- While either of these abilities are up, the player will not pulled in by the cleave and the cocoon special attack will not last as long. \u2b25 Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if Araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave. Cleave \u2b25 Araxxor pulls you in and hits the player with a large typeless hit unless the player can get out of the attack range. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The player can simply stand at a distance and use Anticipate or Freedom to avoid being dragged in. Cocoon \u2b25 Araxxor Wraps the player in a cocoon, causing them to take damage every tick until they escape. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To escape, simply spam click. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The duration of being wrapped up is greatly reduced if the player has Anticipate or Freedom active before this special attack comes. Web Shield \u2b25 Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. \u2b25 This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This special attack can be used to gain some health back by using on your own hit, \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to use Snipe for the same reason. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Be wary of Crackling and Aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back. Minion Spawn \u2b25 Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly. \u2b25 When path 1 is open, this special attack can occur on Phase 3/4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 if Path 1 was taken, minions can also be spawned on Phase 2 \u2b25 Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a Mirrorback or Pulsing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the first wave, it's the third to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the second wave, it's the second to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the third wave, it's the first to spawn. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is no special spider in the fourth wave. Egg Bomb \u2b25 Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs and fire a slow moving projectile at you. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will take 300 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 2 eggs are exploded, the player will take 1200 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 1 egg is exploded, the player will take 2100 damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If 0 eggs are exploded, the player will take 3000 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider \u2b25 Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. \u2b25 The Acid Spider will start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 when it fills up fully, the spider will explode and you will be safe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 its speed is variable. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To deal with this, you can either: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Barricade or Immortality to negate the damage from the spider. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bladed Dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Run away or dodge it if you have room to do so. Acid Spiders \u2b25 On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn Acid Spiders. These can be lured into Araxxor to reduce the enrage of the boss. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To do this, click on them and lure them beneath Araxxor. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is better to just ignore these spiders. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots \u2b25 The Room will go dark and there will be a lit up spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-range/#overview-of-the-fight","text":"Phase 1 \u2b25 Choose which path you want to open up by clicking on the web blocking it at the start of the fight.

If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can conserve food by using Resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Note: You can use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline.

If it does this, move one tile to make it start bouncing around again.

The fight requires 115 Slayer (boostable) and a Key to the Crossing for each kill attempt. He is primarily killed for his Phylactery drops, which are used to create the t92 melee Khopeshes of Tumeken and Elidinis . It is highly recommended to have at least t90 weapons and to be on a Berserker aura, as his defence is high. Being on a Soul Devourer task will boost Tuska's Wrath damage to the boss, however the Slayer Helm and Genocidal perk effects do not work. Each Magister kill is worth 3,962,229, with 622,916 of that being profit. Advanced players can get up to: \u2b25 85 kph kph with Magic, earning on average 52,947,902 gp/hr. \u2b25 90 kph kph with Melee, earning on average 56,062,484 gp/hr. \u2b25 85 kph kph with Range, earning on average 52,947,902 gp/hr. Drops \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Vital Spark 1/64 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Phylactery 1/18 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Gloves of Passage 1/500 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Soul Fragment 1/1000 (200 threshold) Presets General \u2b25 Bring as many keys as you're comfortable with. When starting out you can have more food and less keys, but food should generally be removed. With max gear you will have 100% hit chance, so a ripper demon is recommended. If you have lower tier gear, a nihil is recommended. \u2b25 Additionally, a Luck of the Dwarves is viable at Magister, as it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, which can save the player 30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh. This is roughly equal to a 10% increase in gross profit. \u2b25 Vital spark drop enhancers will also increase your profits, since Magister will uncommonly drop vital sparks . It awards an additional vital spark upon receiving one as a drop, and is consumed in the process. They are obtained from Bryll Thoksdottir's reward shop for 1000 Dungeoneering tokens each. \u2b25 It is recommended to bring 2 Super Restores . However if you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use Spiritual Prayers instead. Magic \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Essence of Finality Guthix staff spec stored \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Melee For lower skill level players, camping a Noxious Scythe is recommended. For higher skill players with access to a ZGS , they have no need for a scythe. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Essence of Finality Dragon Claws spec stored Ranged Eldritch Crossbow is strong due to its special attack, in combo with Onyx Bolts to maintain a healing capacity during the spec. Next are Blightbound Crossbows for Needle Strike and their access to Bakriminel bolts. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Essence of Finality Dark bow spec stored Familiar Choice Magister has very high defense so if undergeared, it is generally a good idea to consider using a Nihil to limit splashing. However, with T92 weapons and zerk aura you are able to obtain essentially 100% accuracy (always slightly less due to how curse drain works) so a Ripper Demon with scrolls is a stronger choice. Note that although you should bring Spiritual Prayers when using a Ripper Demon , you do not want to juice them as maximizing inventory space for keys is more important than the dps juicing would achieve. High end melee with a Vampyrism Scrimshaw can utilize a Blood Reaver to achieve more passive dps than a Ripper Demon with scrolls. This does not work for magic and range. The Fight The Magister rotates between a set of special attacks randomly with 3 actions in between. This action counter resets back to 3 at 150k, 100k, and 50k hitpoints remaining. His actions include an auto attack, Resonance, Freedom, Siphon, and Dashing. He can do some of these actions very rapidly in succession which makes his special attack timings relatively unpredictable. 150k HP The Soul Obelisk used to start the fight will activate and continuously reduce the player's Constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints too), causing food to heal less if your level falls below that which is required by the food to heal to its full potential (Saradomin Brews and Guthix Rests are exempt from this effect). 3 Constitution levels are lost each time the effect triggers. This drain may be counteracted by drinking a Super Restore . Damaging this pillar will also restore your maximum HP, however this pillar should always be ignored. If you kill the Magister quickly enough, this mechanic becomes irrelevant. 100k HP An additional soul obelisk spawns at the south side of the room, dealing 600 damage every 5-7 seconds and raising the player's corruption level by 4%, causing player's damage dealt and taken to go up by the same percentage. This is beneficial as the boss is very DPS focused so just ignore the obelisk. The maximum value this can reach during a fight is 50% however this resets to 25% when Magister dies (if the player was below 25% corruption it does not go up to 25%, only down). 50k HP The Magister goes berserk, increasing his damage output while losing some defence. Kill him off quickly before he can deal too much damage onto the player. Mechanics Resonance Magister will heal for the damage you would have dealt, if you spot this mechanic and you have not yet used an ability, it is best to use a bleed or a weak ability to minimise his healing. Mutated dazing shot's puncture bleed does a good job of stripping this effect off semi-consistently. Freedom Magister cannot freedom while stunned, he will only use freedom when he is bound, including 0.6s micro-binds at the end of abilities such as impact. While he will not directly aim to clear bleeds using this, he can indirectly do so should you bind him before or during your bleed. As such you should be mindful of using ability combinations such as: \u2b25 / \u2192 \u2b25 \u2192 \u2b25 \u2192 Siphon Magister will only use this when the player is at or above 70% adrenaline, draining some of their adrenaline. As such the player should aim to maintain a level of adrenaline below 70% during their ultimates so that they don't lose adrenaline which should have been used for critical thresholds. They should also be wary of \u200e \u200ethis mechanic just before using their ultimates as it can cause the player to be drained and accidentally drink an Adrenaline potion from 90-100% instead of inside their ultimate after being drained. This can be avoided by delaying drinking your apot until after you know you have used your ultimate, or by using a stun such as Impact , Backhand , Horror and the like before using their ultimate. These last long enough to prevent the magister from siphoning the player if they use their ultimate immediately after. Note: The three abilities mentioned above happen replace an auto attack and instead delay Magister's next auto attack by only 0.6s. Specials Power Blast The Magister slams his staff into the ground, sending out a red lightning attack towards the player. This attack deals ranged damage and can either be ignored or partially negated by flicking to Deflect Missiles or by using Disruption Shield . If you are struggling for food on trips you can use Resonance . This attack is 100% accurate and deals ~2300 damage unmitigated. Barge This mechanic is signaled by the voice line \"You dare fight me?\" After a 1.8s delay, the Magister will barge to 1 sq south of player's location, dealing around 2300 melee damage in a 5x5 area and disabling protection prayers for a small duration. This can be avoided by moving out of the way, it is recommended you move North as this gives you a 1.2s time window to react, moving East or West leaves you with only 0.6s and to dodge it by running South is always an accident as you already have to be running that way when the mechanic starts. If you find this time window small, Resonance or simply ignoring it is an easier way of dealing with this mechanic. \u2b25 Resonance is also a good option if you wish to make the most of a channel such as Rapid Fire or Asphyxiate but can not afford to lose the lifepoints to face tank the Barge. Melee should use Disruption Shield to mitigate this mechanic losslessly, the healing is unnecessary with the use of a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism \u2b25 Move 1 square away afterwards, as being melee distance to the boss can trigger the following mechanic. Stand Still The Magister will yell \"Stand still!\" and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. It's possible for this combo damage to be very high as he will immediately do a Mage attack after escaping, if you do get hit, use Freedom and pray Deflect Magic . This is avoided by simply not standing in melee range of the boss, but if the player is using Melee, they should use a halberd at 2 tile range at lower skill levels. Another method is to step away from Magister when he may do a special attack, his ability to do rapid consecutive actions can make this difficult and therefore requires high skill and insight to do well. \u200e \u200eThis mechanic is instant and thus cannot be reacted to proactively, this makes Resonance not an option. Note: This mechanic replaces the Barge mechanic while the player is in melee distance. Dashing Magister will only dash away from the player during his Stand Still special attack. Magister will dash away from the starting pillar in a random direction up to 8 tiles if he is stood too close to it, this usually happens after he uses his Barge \u200e \u200especial attack on a player stood close to the starting pillar. The Magister can chain these actions together, even up to three in a row (although extremely rare) between special attacks and go spec to spec without any auto attacks inbetween whatsoever. Unstable Mixture A bomb will be thrown in the general vicinity of the player and will explode after the bar above it fills, dealing typeless damage in a 5x5 area, if caught in the radius this is 4000 damage to the player, 4000 damage to the magister (multiplied by vuln) and 2000 damage to the player's familiar. There appear to be 3 versions of this special attack: a fast bomb, a slow bomb, and a bomb with no visible timer. Furthermore, if the player stands on the tile the bomb is about to land on, the bomb does not spawn. If you restart a kill quickly enough, a bomb from a previous kill can hit him in the next kill. Bombs can be clicked on to kick it in the opposite direction of the player -- doing so removes the area of effect properties. Note: If the player is stood on top of the bomb, it will always be kicked south by default. Asphyxiate The Magister will asphyxiate the player, doing a consistent amount of magic damage for 3 hits and healing off the base damage (Berserker multipliers and any mitigations are not counted, although corruption is). This ability does not stun and can be dealt with by moving or by using a melee threshold. This is 100% accurate on each hit, each hit can deal anywhere between 1500-3000 damage unmitigated however every hit deals the same amount of damage as the others. The player should take care to not stun him during this special attack as this will cause him to resume auto-attacking as soon as the stun wears off, even in the middle of his Asphyxiate, causing unnecessary damage. If stunned by accident, the player should make an effort to chain their stuns to keep him stun locked. Restore Me The Magister will regain several thousand lifepoints. He is much more likely to use this after falling below 50k lifepoints and it is often the first special attack he will use at that point. This can be avoided by stun-locking him, dealing damage and killing him before he gets the chance to use a special attack. Try not to burn too many thresholds for this purpose as you may end up wasting more damage in the long run than the healing you're aiming to prevent. You can also ignore this point but keep in mind it may take a bit longer than it seems to finish him off. Minions This mechanic only happens once the magister has performed a sufficient number of special attacks beforehand, it is particularly cumbersome and powerful and as such the player should aim to avoid it at all costs: \u2b25 Two Soul Devourer minions will spawn using random combat styles. These have 10,000 HP and will remain until either they die or the fight ends. These deal moderate damage and it is recommended to kill them unless the fight is at least halfway over, melee spawns can be kited with ranged and magic. \u2b25 To minimise your chances of receiving this mechanic you should focus on having high DPS to reset his action counter to 3 as fast as possible (at 150k, 100k and 50k) before he has a chance to use a special attack on some of these phases. Stun-locking the Magister and stunning him in general can be very helpful to this end. Note: Players with consistent kill times less than 1 minute should never see this special. \u2b25 If the player finds they are taking too much damage, they can use a Feather of Ma'at to cleanse their corruption and gain some breathing room, this does however make the next kill or two slower, if the player has to resort to this consistently, it is recommended they practice their DPS more before continuing. Note: The Magister will deal more damage when below 50,000 lifepoints, resulting in some of these attacks dealing damage in the mid 3000s. Protecting Your Familiar As mentioned previously, the main recommended familiars are a Ripper Demon , a Nihil , or a Blood Reaver (high end melee only). All of these familiars have relatively low lifepoints, particularly the ancient summoning familiars, so some attention is needed in order to keep your familiar alive. Tricks to Protect Your Familiar \u2b25 Try to kick the Unstable Mixture at the Magister as often as you can instead of avoiding it, as this will otherwise frequently hit your familiar for 2,000 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This means 5 Mixtures hitting your Blood Reaver during your trip will kill it, 6 Mixtures will kill your Ripper Demon , and 10 will kill your Nihil . \u2b25 Avoiding kicking the bomb when the Magister is dead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the case that your familiar is stood in the direction you kick the Mixture, it can hit your familiar for 4,000 damage. \u2b25 Pray at War's Altar in War's Retreat between trips to restore your familiar's hitpoints. Strategy General \u2b25 Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath , Wild Magic , Snap Shot etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with Tuska's Wrath , where it may hit 20k+ in zerk but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to Assault hits under Berserk and Detonate / Guthix Staff EoF / Wrack and Ruin under Sunshine as well. \u2b25 Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such, if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This only really applies to the Seren Godbow and Noxious longbow at 9 tiles when he is bound. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This also has the implication that he sometimes will phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly which is something to be aware of, meanING you should be even more wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds, lest they get mitigated. \u2b25 For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it. This will allow you to have higher corruption stacks for the 2nd and 3rd kill for the entire kill, as such you'll be doing more damage overall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Don't sandbag the speed of the kill. You want to kill him at pace to hit 16-20% corruption by the end of the first kill. \u2b25 If you're getting fast kills, don't pick up your drop after the kill, pick it up during your next one or once every 2-3 kills in a set. Magic (~85 KPH) Introduction Magister is not immune to stuns or binds although he possesses the ability to freedom occassionally. Despite this, a player doing proper 4TAA with ice spell auto attacks should be able to consider him near permanently bound for the purpose of using Bound Wrack to improve overall damage output. Exsanguinate should be optimally paired as the autocast spell; however, undergeared players may find more success with autocast for better sustain. To improve at killing Magister with magic, you must look to optimize 3 things: \u2b25 Consistent Dps \u2b25 Self-Sustain \u2b25 Downtime between Kills These three things are interrelated and can be improved upon by looking to improve in 3 key ways: \u2b25 Improving your Consistent Dps \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This will also improve your ability to self-sustain as you heal more through Soul Split \u2b25 Learning to Efficiently Chain Kills \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Chaining kills is the secret reaching the top kph's with magic as it leads to higher Sunshine uptime and more consistent dps \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An important aspect of chaining kills is reducing the downtime between kills as being slow will often lead to lost time in \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Looting every few kills with Area Looting rather than every other kill will assist in reducing the downtime between kills \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Recent changes allow you to keep the Area Loot interface open throughout your entire trip, allowing you to repeatedly loot from several squares away without interrupting your rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to turn on the Always use Loot Interface setting as the most difficult part of Area Looting is openning the interface early every trip. \u2b25 Maximizing Kills Per Trip \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Possibly your single biggest loss in downtime between kills is banking at Wars Retreat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A single tele, bank, and tele back takes around 30s. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Banking also resets your corruption stacks which take 3-4 kills to fully rebuild every trip. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Improving your self-sustain through and dps is essential to achieving this goal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bringing very little but strong food is the ideal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- At the top end, you should rarely if ever need more than Excal and a few brew doses. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Magister is one of the few bosses where using Super Saradomin Brews is advised as you will at max consume 2 an hour, and they offer the security needed to avoid death if a trip goes down hill in a single inventory slot. Ultimate Usage \u2b25 Start with a Sunshine and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb every kill. Depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary. Note: You want to around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of Magister (1 square away), this gives you ample space to avoid the Unstable Mixture while staying in your . \u2b25 Depending on the player's DPS, kill times can go down to 30 seconds. \u200e \u200eWith good DPS, the ideal is to chain across kills to maximize uptime, for example using for the last 100k HP of kill A then the first 100k HP of kill B. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Until you are comfortable chaining kills try not to below 60K HP. \u200e \u200eThis will ensure you maximize the value of Apot and Limitless . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With good DPS and experience chaining kills, maximizing overall uptime should be prioritized at the cost of / value. Ability Prioritization \u2b25 If using mainly Auto Attacks or Not using 4TAA \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Walked Combust and Corruption Blast is very strong and should be utilized heavily outside of . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Shock and Horror can be used to walk bleeds when your dreadnips stuns him at an unfortunate time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- can be used in if you have extra adren, followed by a Bound . \u2b25 If using mainly Auto Attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 allows for consistent usage of Bound -- a 188% basic with a 3s cooldown -- to greatly increase your damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 can trigger Magister's mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is not an issue for the combo; however, it will lead to Magister commonly clearing bleeds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- should be avoided as Magister will be consistently bound on top of the clear risk. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- is still strong due to its frontloaded damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A good way to still use is to try to pop his immediately before using it with ability combinations such as \u2192 . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Energizing perk does not actually decrease the damage of while providing consistent bonus adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This makes the Energizing 4 perk BiS for mage Magister when utilizing -- replace either Enhanced Devoted or Invigorating. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Energizing is especially nice when siphoned at 100 adren right before activating as will always generate the 10 adren lost. \u2b25 Using Autocast and \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ideally use alongside auto attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- All notes above still apply while using \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If stuggling with sustain, opt for auto attacks at the cost of spamming \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Wrack and Ruin should be treated similarly to Tuska's Wrath on task \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Look to use as soon as it is available \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Beware of Hp thresholds and avoid using less than 10k before cap. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Like on task , is capable of early phasing when used in . Example Trip (Courtesy of #Akva) https://youtu.be/Uc67vezQMUQ Melee (~85 KPH) For melee you'll have to be watching his actions closely and when you expect him to be able to spec, stall your abilities outside of MD and click back onto him once he either performs his next auto attack or does his special attack, when you click back on him to release your stalled ability, press your next ability to stack them on top of eachother, this allows you to losslessly leave melee distance. You will develop an instinct/gut feeling for this in time, however for beginners you will be stunned alot. Alternatively, use a scythe and stand outside of melee distance. Kills \u2b25 Every other kill, Berserk + Adren Pot and do your berserk rotation, make use of Greater Barge if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Then every other kill start the kill with a ZGS spec , if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of Greater Barge , however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by the bleed. \u2b25 Threshold order: Destroy (or Hurricane ) first, Assault second (and Greater Flurry , if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next. \u2b25 Finish the kills with Slaughter and Blood Tendrils , as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use Kick or Stomp to walk the bleed instead. \u2b25 In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most, if not all, kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or limitless coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use Greater Flurry /Destroy (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to Berserk . \u2b25 If you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with Destroy for example, you can interrupt on the 3rd hit with Punish and run outside of melee distance on the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Magister can attack before you get your 4th hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, you can keep channeling your through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase, thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining attacks and removing the possibility of being stunned. Melee Rotations (Courtesy of #Nubbyn) \u2b25 Kill 1 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3-hit) \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2b25 Kill 2 (tc) (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (improv, finish with 91%+ adren) \u2b25 Kill 3 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (2-hit) \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (improv, finish with 75%+ adren) \u2b25 Kill 4 repeat Kill 2 rotation \u2b25 Repeat these four rotations for the remainder of the trip. On the last kill of a trip, or if you think you're about to get a personal record, you can use to burst the last 50k. \u2b25 On the kills you Berserk , if 91%+ adren, target him, \u2192 \u2192 . After walking Slaughter , evaluate your adren and Magister's hp to see if thresholds can still be used and finish the kill with 75%+ adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughtr . \u2b25 Dual wield Assault is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, as with 2h has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel. This helps in going over Magister's hard cap every 50k lp. \u2b25 Use Punish as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips. \u2b25 Walk Slaughter by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use Kick . Following these rotations, with \u200e \u200egood perks and BiS gear, you generally won't have to worry about actual mechanics until the last 50k hp, as if done right he will either be stunned or you do quick enough damage between every 50k hp he doesn't have time to do a special attack. If you feel the phase is going slower than it should, consider running away between every ability as his stun/dash/stand still are the most annoying specials to deal with. Example Trip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZBOQ--5Uis Ranged (~85 KPH) Kills \u2b25 Start with a Death's Swiftness and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb every kill. Again, depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary. Note: Death's Swiftness around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away). \u2b25 Demoralise and Rout should not be used, as they lack the 10s bind which means you can't abuse Piercing Shot in tandem. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sticky bombs can also be used to keep the Magister bound, so that Piercing Shot can be used freely as a 188% ability, allowing you to push bleeds. \u2b25 With an Eldritch Crossbow , Shadow Tendrils shouldn't be used at all in order to conserve HP. Feel free to use them otherwise. \u2b25 If you have an Eldritch Crossbow , you can use its special attack in combination with Greater Ricochet followed by Rapid Fire and Snap Shot while Death's Swiftness is on cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hydrix bolts can be used to cover the adrenaline cost to have 100% in time for Death's Swiftness and these will likely proc within this time frame. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Onyx bolts can alternatively provide healing if needed. Example Trip (Courtesy of #mionee) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4jRuC8o_U0 Low Effort Ranged Strategy (65-80kph) (Courtesy of #Hells) Profit Total varies largely on the selling price of khopeshes and the buying price of keys, but this method will make 43,604,154 gp/h profit on average at 70kph. Explanation \u2b25 This method will require you to manually activate the obelisk with a key each kill, as well as throw a vuln bomb at the magister at the beginning of each fight. \u2b25 This method has a substantially high startup cost and a moderately high upkeep cost. \u2b25 Your main source of healing comes from soulsplit effects, so it is very important to have it activated. \u2b25 It is preferable that you do this method on a soul devourer slayer task, as the extra damage dealt by Tuska's Wrath and the Genocidal perk is significant. However, it is perfectly fine to do off task. \u2b25 At the beginning of each kill, it is important to throw a vulnerability bomb directly onto the magister (i.e. click the magister when throwing the bomb). \u2b25 Due to the unpredictable and hard-hitting nature of the Magister's special attacks, eating food to survive is required at times, although this happens rarely. Aura Choice Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u2b25 Reckless Aura is the best aura to use, as this method suffers with accuracy issues due to magister being a boss with high defence. \u2b25 T4 Sharpshooter Aura may also be used, due to the aforementioned accuracy issues. May require a little more supervison. Note: All other auras are not recommended due to you otherwise having an extremely low hitchance. Weapon Choice Weapon choice can vary, but will affect how afk/fast kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u2b25 An Eldritch Crossbow is the best weapon of choice for this method. The 2h crossbow range allows you to stand next to the obelisk, minimizing movement and inputs needed, while concistently maintaining a very low killtime. \u2b25 Wyvern Crossbow is also a good budget weapon to use due to its strong poison passive. \u2b25 A Hexhunter Bow may also be used. However this means that you will need to run back to the obelisk after each kill to activate it, and you risk getting stunned by the Magister's 'Stand Still' mechanic. This method has higher kph than wyvern, but is less reliable on sustain. \u2b25 Lower tiered weapons will not work as this method requires you to kill the Magister before he spawns his soul devourer minions. Recommended Familiar There are two familiar options for this method: Ripper Demon with scrolls or Shadow Nihil . Follow these guidelines to determine the better option for you: \u2b25 If using Sharpshooter aura instead of Reckless aura, is preferred \u2b25 If using Wyvern Crossbow + Anguish , is preferred \u2b25 If using Eldritch Crossbow or Desolation , with scrolls is preferred Mandatory Requirements This setup should reliably allow you to semi-afk the Magister. However, the following need to be done or else this method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners will result in failure : \u2b25 You are standing next to the obelisk \u2b25 Adrenaline retention is active if you are not activating the obelisk as soon as the previous kill ends \u2b25 Greater Ricochet and Salt the Wound are unlocked \u2b25 Caroming 4 is on your weapon \u2b25 Soulsplit is active \u2b25 Anguish or Desolation is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Desolation is much more highly recommended due to the aforementioned accuracy issues \u2b25 Elder Overload is active \u2b25 Weapon Poison +++ is active \u2b25 Cinderbane Gloves are equipped \u2b25 Recommended Familiar is summoned (see above) \u2b25 Auto-retaliate is on Preset \u2b25 Persistent Rage Relic - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an Adrenaline Urn . Can be completely removed if player is doing kills back to back with minimal delay. \u2b25 Death Ward Relic - Highly recommended since it provides a substantial reduction to damage taken throughout the hour. \u2b25 Ogre Flask (Thermal) - Used before the hour to increase a player's total hp. Can be stacked with of bonfire boost. This helps negate the Soul Obelisk mechanic where it will activate and continuously reduce the player's Constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints too). \u2b25 Kwuarm Incense Sticks - Provide extra poison damage. \u2b25 Spirit Weed Incense Sticks - Used if using a Ripper Demon with scrolls to increase the spec-rate of the ripper. \u2b25 Essence of Finality - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and Soulsplit passive. \u2b25 Luck of the Dwarves - Used to increase phylactery chance from 1/18 to 1/17, greatly increasing the profit obtained. \u2b25 Book of Balance - Decent passive pocket item, provides extra poison procs and damage when activated. A scrimshaw of cruelty is also a good alternative. \u2b25 Onyx Bakriminel Bolts (e) - Used only with Wyvern Crossbow . Necessary for the healing they provide.

When starting out you can have more food and less keys, but food should generally be removed. With max gear you will have 100% hit chance, so a ripper demon is recommended. If you have lower tier gear, a nihil is recommended. \u2b25 Additionally, a Luck of the Dwarves is viable at Magister, as it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, which can save the player 30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh. This is roughly equal to a 10% increase in gross profit. \u2b25 Vital spark drop enhancers will also increase your profits, since Magister will uncommonly drop vital sparks . It awards an additional vital spark upon receiving one as a drop, and is consumed in the process. They are obtained from Bryll Thoksdottir's reward shop for 1000 Dungeoneering tokens each. \u2b25 It is recommended to bring 2 Super Restores . However if you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use Spiritual Prayers instead.

However, with T92 weapons and zerk aura you are able to obtain essentially 100% accuracy (always slightly less due to how curse drain works) so a Ripper Demon with scrolls is a stronger choice. Note that although you should bring Spiritual Prayers when using a Ripper Demon , you do not want to juice them as maximizing inventory space for keys is more important than the dps juicing would achieve. High end melee with a Vampyrism Scrimshaw can utilize a Blood Reaver to achieve more passive dps than a Ripper Demon with scrolls. This does not work for magic and range.","title":"Presets"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#the-fight","text":"The Magister rotates between a set of special attacks randomly with 3 actions in between. This action counter resets back to 3 at 150k, 100k, and 50k hitpoints remaining. His actions include an auto attack, Resonance, Freedom, Siphon, and Dashing. He can do some of these actions very rapidly in succession which makes his special attack timings relatively unpredictable. 150k HP The Soul Obelisk used to start the fight will activate and continuously reduce the player's Constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints too), causing food to heal less if your level falls below that which is required by the food to heal to its full potential (Saradomin Brews and Guthix Rests are exempt from this effect). 3 Constitution levels are lost each time the effect triggers. This drain may be counteracted by drinking a Super Restore . Damaging this pillar will also restore your maximum HP, however this pillar should always be ignored. If you kill the Magister quickly enough, this mechanic becomes irrelevant. 100k HP An additional soul obelisk spawns at the south side of the room, dealing 600 damage every 5-7 seconds and raising the player's corruption level by 4%, causing player's damage dealt and taken to go up by the same percentage. This is beneficial as the boss is very DPS focused so just ignore the obelisk. The maximum value this can reach during a fight is 50% however this resets to 25% when Magister dies (if the player was below 25% corruption it does not go up to 25%, only down). 50k HP The Magister goes berserk, increasing his damage output while losing some defence. Kill him off quickly before he can deal too much damage onto the player.","title":"The Fight"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#mechanics","text":"Resonance Magister will heal for the damage you would have dealt, if you spot this mechanic and you have not yet used an ability, it is best to use a bleed or a weak ability to minimise his healing. Mutated dazing shot's puncture bleed does a good job of stripping this effect off semi-consistently. Freedom Magister cannot freedom while stunned, he will only use freedom when he is bound, including 0.6s micro-binds at the end of abilities such as impact. While he will not directly aim to clear bleeds using this, he can indirectly do so should you bind him before or during your bleed. As such you should be mindful of using ability combinations such as: \u2b25 / \u2192 \u2b25 \u2192 \u2b25 \u2192 Siphon Magister will only use this when the player is at or above 70% adrenaline, draining some of their adrenaline. As such the player should aim to maintain a level of adrenaline below 70% during their ultimates so that they don't lose adrenaline which should have been used for critical thresholds. They should also be wary of \u200e \u200ethis mechanic just before using their ultimates as it can cause the player to be drained and accidentally drink an Adrenaline potion from 90-100% instead of inside their ultimate after being drained. This can be avoided by delaying drinking your apot until after you know you have used your ultimate, or by using a stun such as Impact , Backhand , Horror and the like before using their ultimate. These last long enough to prevent the magister from siphoning the player if they use their ultimate immediately after. Note: The three abilities mentioned above happen replace an auto attack and instead delay Magister's next auto attack by only 0.6s.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#specials","text":"Power Blast The Magister slams his staff into the ground, sending out a red lightning attack towards the player. This attack deals ranged damage and can either be ignored or partially negated by flicking to Deflect Missiles or by using Disruption Shield . If you are struggling for food on trips you can use Resonance . This attack is 100% accurate and deals ~2300 damage unmitigated. Barge This mechanic is signaled by the voice line \"You dare fight me?\" After a 1.8s delay, the Magister will barge to 1 sq south of player's location, dealing around 2300 melee damage in a 5x5 area and disabling protection prayers for a small duration. This can be avoided by moving out of the way, it is recommended you move North as this gives you a 1.2s time window to react, moving East or West leaves you with only 0.6s and to dodge it by running South is always an accident as you already have to be running that way when the mechanic starts. If you find this time window small, Resonance or simply ignoring it is an easier way of dealing with this mechanic. \u2b25 Resonance is also a good option if you wish to make the most of a channel such as Rapid Fire or Asphyxiate but can not afford to lose the lifepoints to face tank the Barge. Melee should use Disruption Shield to mitigate this mechanic losslessly, the healing is unnecessary with the use of a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism \u2b25 Move 1 square away afterwards, as being melee distance to the boss can trigger the following mechanic. Stand Still The Magister will yell \"Stand still!\" and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. It's possible for this combo damage to be very high as he will immediately do a Mage attack after escaping, if you do get hit, use Freedom and pray Deflect Magic . This is avoided by simply not standing in melee range of the boss, but if the player is using Melee, they should use a halberd at 2 tile range at lower skill levels. Another method is to step away from Magister when he may do a special attack, his ability to do rapid consecutive actions can make this difficult and therefore requires high skill and insight to do well. \u200e \u200eThis mechanic is instant and thus cannot be reacted to proactively, this makes Resonance not an option. Note: This mechanic replaces the Barge mechanic while the player is in melee distance. Dashing Magister will only dash away from the player during his Stand Still special attack. Magister will dash away from the starting pillar in a random direction up to 8 tiles if he is stood too close to it, this usually happens after he uses his Barge \u200e \u200especial attack on a player stood close to the starting pillar. The Magister can chain these actions together, even up to three in a row (although extremely rare) between special attacks and go spec to spec without any auto attacks inbetween whatsoever. Unstable Mixture A bomb will be thrown in the general vicinity of the player and will explode after the bar above it fills, dealing typeless damage in a 5x5 area, if caught in the radius this is 4000 damage to the player, 4000 damage to the magister (multiplied by vuln) and 2000 damage to the player's familiar. There appear to be 3 versions of this special attack: a fast bomb, a slow bomb, and a bomb with no visible timer. Furthermore, if the player stands on the tile the bomb is about to land on, the bomb does not spawn. If you restart a kill quickly enough, a bomb from a previous kill can hit him in the next kill. Bombs can be clicked on to kick it in the opposite direction of the player -- doing so removes the area of effect properties. Note: If the player is stood on top of the bomb, it will always be kicked south by default. Asphyxiate The Magister will asphyxiate the player, doing a consistent amount of magic damage for 3 hits and healing off the base damage (Berserker multipliers and any mitigations are not counted, although corruption is). This ability does not stun and can be dealt with by moving or by using a melee threshold. This is 100% accurate on each hit, each hit can deal anywhere between 1500-3000 damage unmitigated however every hit deals the same amount of damage as the others. The player should take care to not stun him during this special attack as this will cause him to resume auto-attacking as soon as the stun wears off, even in the middle of his Asphyxiate, causing unnecessary damage. If stunned by accident, the player should make an effort to chain their stuns to keep him stun locked. Restore Me The Magister will regain several thousand lifepoints. He is much more likely to use this after falling below 50k lifepoints and it is often the first special attack he will use at that point. This can be avoided by stun-locking him, dealing damage and killing him before he gets the chance to use a special attack. Try not to burn too many thresholds for this purpose as you may end up wasting more damage in the long run than the healing you're aiming to prevent. You can also ignore this point but keep in mind it may take a bit longer than it seems to finish him off. Minions This mechanic only happens once the magister has performed a sufficient number of special attacks beforehand, it is particularly cumbersome and powerful and as such the player should aim to avoid it at all costs: \u2b25 Two Soul Devourer minions will spawn using random combat styles. These have 10,000 HP and will remain until either they die or the fight ends. These deal moderate damage and it is recommended to kill them unless the fight is at least halfway over, melee spawns can be kited with ranged and magic. \u2b25 To minimise your chances of receiving this mechanic you should focus on having high DPS to reset his action counter to 3 as fast as possible (at 150k, 100k and 50k) before he has a chance to use a special attack on some of these phases. Stun-locking the Magister and stunning him in general can be very helpful to this end. Note: Players with consistent kill times less than 1 minute should never see this special. \u2b25 If the player finds they are taking too much damage, they can use a Feather of Ma'at to cleanse their corruption and gain some breathing room, this does however make the next kill or two slower, if the player has to resort to this consistently, it is recommended they practice their DPS more before continuing. Note: The Magister will deal more damage when below 50,000 lifepoints, resulting in some of these attacks dealing damage in the mid 3000s.","title":"Specials"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#protecting-your-familiar","text":"As mentioned previously, the main recommended familiars are a Ripper Demon , a Nihil , or a Blood Reaver (high end melee only). All of these familiars have relatively low lifepoints, particularly the ancient summoning familiars, so some attention is needed in order to keep your familiar alive. Tricks to Protect Your Familiar \u2b25 Try to kick the Unstable Mixture at the Magister as often as you can instead of avoiding it, as this will otherwise frequently hit your familiar for 2,000 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This means 5 Mixtures hitting your Blood Reaver during your trip will kill it, 6 Mixtures will kill your Ripper Demon , and 10 will kill your Nihil . \u2b25 Avoiding kicking the bomb when the Magister is dead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the case that your familiar is stood in the direction you kick the Mixture, it can hit your familiar for 4,000 damage. \u2b25 Pray at War's Altar in War's Retreat between trips to restore your familiar's hitpoints.","title":"Protecting Your Familiar"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#strategy","text":"General \u2b25 Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath , Wild Magic , Snap Shot etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with Tuska's Wrath , where it may hit 20k+ in zerk but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to Assault hits under Berserk and Detonate / Guthix Staff EoF / Wrack and Ruin under Sunshine as well. \u2b25 Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such, if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This only really applies to the Seren Godbow and Noxious longbow at 9 tiles when he is bound. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This also has the implication that he sometimes will phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly which is something to be aware of, meanING you should be even more wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds, lest they get mitigated. \u2b25 For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it.

Ultimate Usage \u2b25 Start with a Sunshine and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb every kill. Depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary.

Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Then every other kill start the kill with a ZGS spec , if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of Greater Barge , however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by the bleed. \u2b25 Threshold order: Destroy (or Hurricane ) first, Assault second (and Greater Flurry , if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next. \u2b25 Finish the kills with Slaughter and Blood Tendrils , as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use Kick or Stomp to walk the bleed instead. \u2b25 In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most, if not all, kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or limitless coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use Greater Flurry /Destroy (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to Berserk . \u2b25 If you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with Destroy for example, you can interrupt on the 3rd hit with Punish and run outside of melee distance on the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Magister can attack before you get your 4th hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, you can keep channeling your through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase, thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining attacks and removing the possibility of being stunned.

After walking Slaughter , evaluate your adren and Magister's hp to see if thresholds can still be used and finish the kill with 75%+ adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughtr . \u2b25 Dual wield Assault is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, as with 2h has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel. This helps in going over Magister's hard cap every 50k lp. \u2b25 Use Punish as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips. \u2b25 Walk Slaughter by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use Kick . Following these rotations, with \u200e \u200egood perks and BiS gear, you generally won't have to worry about actual mechanics until the last 50k hp, as if done right he will either be stunned or you do quick enough damage between every 50k hp he doesn't have time to do a special attack. If you feel the phase is going slower than it should, consider running away between every ability as his stun/dash/stand still are the most annoying specials to deal with.

Note: Death's Swiftness around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away). \u2b25 Demoralise and Rout should not be used, as they lack the 10s bind which means you can't abuse Piercing Shot in tandem. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sticky bombs can also be used to keep the Magister bound, so that Piercing Shot can be used freely as a 188% ability, allowing you to push bleeds. \u2b25 With an Eldritch Crossbow , Shadow Tendrils shouldn't be used at all in order to conserve HP.

Explanation \u2b25 This method will require you to manually activate the obelisk with a key each kill, as well as throw a vuln bomb at the magister at the beginning of each fight. \u2b25 This method has a substantially high startup cost and a moderately high upkeep cost. \u2b25 Your main source of healing comes from soulsplit effects, so it is very important to have it activated. \u2b25 It is preferable that you do this method on a soul devourer slayer task, as the extra damage dealt by Tuska's Wrath and the Genocidal perk is significant. However, it is perfectly fine to do off task. \u2b25 At the beginning of each kill, it is important to throw a vulnerability bomb directly onto the magister (i.e. click the magister when throwing the bomb). \u2b25 Due to the unpredictable and hard-hitting nature of the Magister's special attacks, eating food to survive is required at times, although this happens rarely. Aura Choice Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u2b25 Reckless Aura is the best aura to use, as this method suffers with accuracy issues due to magister being a boss with high defence. \u2b25 T4 Sharpshooter Aura may also be used, due to the aforementioned accuracy issues. May require a little more supervison. Note: All other auras are not recommended due to you otherwise having an extremely low hitchance. Weapon Choice Weapon choice can vary, but will affect how afk/fast kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u2b25 An Eldritch Crossbow is the best weapon of choice for this method. The 2h crossbow range allows you to stand next to the obelisk, minimizing movement and inputs needed, while concistently maintaining a very low killtime. \u2b25 Wyvern Crossbow is also a good budget weapon to use due to its strong poison passive. \u2b25 A Hexhunter Bow may also be used. However this means that you will need to run back to the obelisk after each kill to activate it, and you risk getting stunned by the Magister's 'Stand Still' mechanic. This method has higher kph than wyvern, but is less reliable on sustain. \u2b25 Lower tiered weapons will not work as this method requires you to kill the Magister before he spawns his soul devourer minions. Recommended Familiar There are two familiar options for this method: Ripper Demon with scrolls or Shadow Nihil . Follow these guidelines to determine the better option for you: \u2b25 If using Sharpshooter aura instead of Reckless aura, is preferred \u2b25 If using Wyvern Crossbow + Anguish , is preferred \u2b25 If using Eldritch Crossbow or Desolation , with scrolls is preferred Mandatory Requirements This setup should reliably allow you to semi-afk the Magister. However, the following need to be done or else this method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners will result in failure : \u2b25 You are standing next to the obelisk \u2b25 Adrenaline retention is active if you are not activating the obelisk as soon as the previous kill ends \u2b25 Greater Ricochet and Salt the Wound are unlocked \u2b25 Caroming 4 is on your weapon \u2b25 Soulsplit is active \u2b25 Anguish or Desolation is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Desolation is much more highly recommended due to the aforementioned accuracy issues \u2b25 Elder Overload is active \u2b25 Weapon Poison +++ is active \u2b25 Cinderbane Gloves are equipped \u2b25 Recommended Familiar is summoned (see above) \u2b25 Auto-retaliate is on Preset \u2b25 Persistent Rage Relic - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an Adrenaline Urn . Can be completely removed if player is doing kills back to back with minimal delay. \u2b25 Death Ward Relic - Highly recommended since it provides a substantial reduction to damage taken throughout the hour. \u2b25 Ogre Flask (Thermal) - Used before the hour to increase a player's total hp. Can be stacked with of bonfire boost. This helps negate the Soul Obelisk mechanic where it will activate and continuously reduce the player's Constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints too). \u2b25 Kwuarm Incense Sticks - Provide extra poison damage. \u2b25 Spirit Weed Incense Sticks - Used if using a Ripper Demon with scrolls to increase the spec-rate of the ripper. \u2b25 Essence of Finality - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and Soulsplit passive. \u2b25 Luck of the Dwarves - Used to increase phylactery chance from 1/18 to 1/17, greatly increasing the profit obtained. \u2b25 Book of Balance - Decent passive pocket item, provides extra poison procs and damage when activated. A scrimshaw of cruelty is also a good alternative. \u2b25 Onyx Bakriminel Bolts (e) - Used only with Wyvern Crossbow . Necessary for the healing they provide. Without them you cannot expect to survive a couple of kills in a row at best without having to bank. ~500/hr are used. \u2b25 Dragonstone Bakriminel Bolts (e) - Used with Eldritch Crossbow for their extra damage. \u2b25 Super Restore Potions - Used to restore prayer throughout the hour if on a shadow nihil or a ripper without scrolls. If using a ripper with scrolls, replace with spiritual prayer potions . \u2b25 Rune Pouch (Runes for Telegrab) Adjusting for Better Gear \u2b25 If using Eldritch Crossbow replace enchanted onyx bakriminel bolts with enchanted dragonstone bakriminel bolts . Replace super restores with spiritual prayer potions since you should be using a Ripper Demon with scrolls . \u2b25 If using Hexhunter Bow , replace ammo with araxyte arrows. Replace super restores with spiritual prayer potions since you will be using a Ripper Demon with scrolls . \u2b25 You can optimise kph by bringing more keys per trip. This can be done by: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using a rune pouch to store telegrab runes. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Replacing food with keys. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If on a shadow nihil , replacing super restores with a blessed flask . \u2b25 It is also important to note that if bringing more keys, more than one dose of weapon poison +++ may need to be brought, as well as more super restores /spiritual prayer potions . \u2b25 18 keys/inventory is the best quantity for reaching maximum kph.

Raksha can be fought either solo or duo, with linear hp scaling for duo mode. The drop rates for duo are also exactly the same as solo. Each Raksha kill is worth 3,962,229, with 795,714 of that coming from commons. Advanced players can get up to 20 kph, earning on average 79,244,574 gp/hr. Unlocking Raksha Raksha, the Shadow Colossus (Miniquest) \u2b25 Slayercape tele to Laniakea, speak to her about the door at the top of the ruins. \u2b25 Go through all the dialogue, then head to the south west, siphon the purple stuff (Takes like 1 minute). \u2b25 After siphoning the purple stuff, head in through the door and space bar through dialog; miniquest complete. The Fight Raksha has a total HP of 800K in solo mode and 1.6M in duo. Raksha phases every 200K HP in solo mode and 400K HP in duo mode. Throughout the fight, Raksha uses all 3 combat styles to attack a player, but only uses magic or range when the player is not in melee distance. Raksha will also try to move closer to the player if they are not in melee distance. Raksha does a special attack every 4 auto attacks. The special attacks used are pre-defined based on a set order in a phase. Throughout the fight, shadow anima pools (commonly knows as shadow anima blobs) will spawn. Raksha will continously absorb the shadow anima pools, shown below Raksha's HP bar. The shadow absorption increases the damage Raksha deals to the player and reduces the damage it takes from the player. The player will need to kill these shadow anima pools in order to prevent Raksha from absorbing them. Raksha's Rotation Raksha's whole attack rotation throughout the fight can be summarised in the image below. Image courtesy of #Brad Special Attack Information Tail Swipe Raksha will do a Tail Swipe special attack if the player is in Raksha's melee distance. Raksha does a spin animation and hits a 3 square radius around it. Players will get stunned and hit around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, move 2 squares back from scythe distance. Alternatively you can Escape or Bladed Dive . Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes , which disables protection prayers. Charge Raksha will do a Charge special attack if the player is not in melee distance. Raksha charges towards the player, stunning them and hitting around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, players will need to move sideways. Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes , which disables protection prayers. Shadow Bomb The Shadow Bomb will stun a player and a Shadow Bomb will fall from the sky, marked by a target on the ground. If the Shadow Bomb hits the player, they are inflicted with the debuff, preventing them from using protection prayers and deflection curses. This special attack can be avoided by using either Anticipate or Freedom prior and moving 2 tiles out of the shadow bomb's target area. Mind Poison Raksha spawns 2 - 4 shadow orbs near the player, each dealing 600 damage every few ticks until expelled by clicking. If not expelled, they explode for 2,000 - 3,000 damage each. 5X Shockwave The 5X shockwave consists of 5 mage hits on the player. When Raksha uses the Shockwave special attack he will gain enrage from all the currently alive shadow anima blobs. Players can use + Devotion to mitigate the damage from this special attack. Erebus Charge A blue dome surrounds Raksha while he stops attacking and an extra action button appears on the screen. Players will need to deal a minimum of 10,000 damage to break the dome. As the dome explodes, fragments of shadow anima will be scattered throughout the arena. The total damage needed to break the dome depends on how much shadow anima was absorbed in phase 1 - 3. If the player does not destroy the dome, they can hide behind the pillars instead. After the dome has been destroyed, players can pick up the shadow anima scattered throughout the arena and click the action button to gain 10% extra damage per shadow anima collected. Shadow Manifestation Minions Raksha will spawn a 10,000 HP minion for each player. Shadow Manifestations will hit players with a melee attack and if left for too long, will perform a frenzy special attack, rapidly hitting players with melee hits and applying an armour break of 1% per stack. Rockfall Rockfall occurs as a transition special attack between phases 1-3. During the rockfall, 5x5 rocks will spawn every tick, prioritising the current player location. However, if there already is a rock above the player, it will spawn in a random area in the arena. When Raksha uses the rockfall special, 8 anima blobs spawn in the arena. More than 8 anima blobs will spawn in the arena if the shadow absorption rate is more than 0%. Shadow Anima Pools During the fight Raksha will spawn Shadow anima pools (commonly referred to anima pools/blobs/piles.) after the spin/charge special and the rockfall special. Raksha will absorb from these when he uses the Shockwave special attack, or if they are left alive too long in phase 3. Each anima pool has 1000 health and they spawn in 4 different areas in the arena. These must be dealt with right before the Shockwave attack or phase 3. Note: If not dealt with Raksha will gain enrage which gives Raksha healing, damage increase, damage reduction and the Shield on Phase 4 will require more damage to break. Shadow Anima On Phase 4 Raksha will do the Erebus Charge attack. During this attack Raksha will be shielded and dealing damage to the shield drops anima around the arena, destroying the shield will spawn a lot of anima compared to damaging the shield. Anima can be collected by running into the pickup range (5x5). Collecting anima will give you Inner Power stacks. Inner power stacks give the player a 10% damage increase per stack when activated. Inner power can be activated by using the extra action button. When the extra action button is used Inner Power will grant you the damage boost from all the stacks for 30s, during this time you cannot collect more anima. Melee Guide (Courtesy of #Wh) Introduction This assumes you already know the basics of the fight and will focus primarily on the ability rotation. Melee is considerably more accessible than ranged and fast times are still possible even with lower gear. Preset Gear can be downgraded pretty comfortably, however for the rotations included in this guide to be consistent you should at least have Khopeshes , Zaros godsword and Masterwork spear of annihilation .

Raksha does a spin animation and hits a 3 square radius around it. Players will get stunned and hit around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, move 2 squares back from scythe distance. Alternatively you can Escape or Bladed Dive . Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes , which disables protection prayers. Charge Raksha will do a Charge special attack if the player is not in melee distance. Raksha charges towards the player, stunning them and hitting around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, players will need to move sideways. Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes , which disables protection prayers. Shadow Bomb The Shadow Bomb will stun a player and a Shadow Bomb will fall from the sky, marked by a target on the ground. If the Shadow Bomb hits the player, they are inflicted with the debuff, preventing them from using protection prayers and deflection curses. This special attack can be avoided by using either Anticipate or Freedom prior and moving 2 tiles out of the shadow bomb's target area. Mind Poison Raksha spawns 2 - 4 shadow orbs near the player, each dealing 600 damage every few ticks until expelled by clicking. If not expelled, they explode for 2,000 - 3,000 damage each. 5X Shockwave The 5X shockwave consists of 5 mage hits on the player. When Raksha uses the Shockwave special attack he will gain enrage from all the currently alive shadow anima blobs. Players can use + Devotion to mitigate the damage from this special attack. Erebus Charge A blue dome surrounds Raksha while he stops attacking and an extra action button appears on the screen. Players will need to deal a minimum of 10,000 damage to break the dome. As the dome explodes, fragments of shadow anima will be scattered throughout the arena. The total damage needed to break the dome depends on how much shadow anima was absorbed in phase 1 - 3. If the player does not destroy the dome, they can hide behind the pillars instead. After the dome has been destroyed, players can pick up the shadow anima scattered throughout the arena and click the action button to gain 10% extra damage per shadow anima collected. Shadow Manifestation Minions Raksha will spawn a 10,000 HP minion for each player. Shadow Manifestations will hit players with a melee attack and if left for too long, will perform a frenzy special attack, rapidly hitting players with melee hits and applying an armour break of 1% per stack. Rockfall Rockfall occurs as a transition special attack between phases 1-3. During the rockfall, 5x5 rocks will spawn every tick, prioritising the current player location. However, if there already is a rock above the player, it will spawn in a random area in the arena. When Raksha uses the rockfall special, 8 anima blobs spawn in the arena. More than 8 anima blobs will spawn in the arena if the shadow absorption rate is more than 0%. Shadow Anima Pools During the fight Raksha will spawn Shadow anima pools (commonly referred to anima pools/blobs/piles.) after the spin/charge special and the rockfall special. Raksha will absorb from these when he uses the Shockwave special attack, or if they are left alive too long in phase 3. Each anima pool has 1000 health and they spawn in 4 different areas in the arena. These must be dealt with right before the Shockwave attack or phase 3. Note: If not dealt with Raksha will gain enrage which gives Raksha healing, damage increase, damage reduction and the Shield on Phase 4 will require more damage to break. Shadow Anima On Phase 4 Raksha will do the Erebus Charge attack. During this attack Raksha will be shielded and dealing damage to the shield drops anima around the arena, destroying the shield will spawn a lot of anima compared to damaging the shield. Anima can be collected by running into the pickup range (5x5). Collecting anima will give you Inner Power stacks. Inner power stacks give the player a 10% damage increase per stack when activated. Inner power can be activated by using the extra action button. When the extra action button is used Inner Power will grant you the damage boost from all the stacks for 30s, during this time you cannot collect more anima.","title":"Special Attack Information"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/raksha/#melee-guide-courtesy-of-wh","text":"Introduction This assumes you already know the basics of the fight and will focus primarily on the ability rotation.

If you\u2019d like to know more about mechanics it is recommend to watch this video: https://youtu.be/lN5vy1gEh4o IMPORTANT NOTE Use this video SOLELY for explanation of mechanics. The methods are very outdated and not optimal. Introduction RotS is generally done in a team size of 4 and the fight takes place in a split arena where the team is split into pairs. Each side will have 3 brothers, the order of which changes everyday. However you will spend more time running through tunnels than you will actually fighting the brothers, which is why it is important to be proficient at both dps rotations and movement abilties i.e. surge + bladed dive. This is also why having the mobile perk, double surge and bladed dive unlocked is crucial for high kph. At RotS the meta is to AoE the brothers down as fast as possible. Most of the meta and strategy revolve around stacking and luring the brothers so that they can be killed at the same time. By far the best way to do this is to have everyone use mechanised chinchompas and have a Dark bow Essence of Finality. Chinchompas make almost all abilities AoE. In general, all three brothers on a side are stacked on top of each other and then taking advantage of chins AoE to kill them all. Well-executed, this strategy should result in consistent 15-20s kills on any rotation. Additionally, because the ability rotation is independent of the organization of the brothers, it is very consistent and easy to learn and perfect. Each RoTS kill is worth 1,065,448. Advanced players can get up to 46 kph, earning on average 49,010,611 gp/hr. Presets Bladed dive is critical to being able to exit tunnels efficiently and increase KPH. One important thing for RotS is to use the Undead Slayer perk, as it will increase your DPS by a flat 7%. Undead Slayer ability, if owned and activated, will also increase your damage against the brothers by 15% for 10 seconds. Trips are generally ~30 minutes long, it is rare to eat during kills and the majority of your food will be used while in tunnels. This negates the downsides of using sara brews + solids i.e. stat drain will be nullified by the time you are back at pads and since you are out of combat you won't lose adrenaline from solids. Beginner Preset The amount of food can be adjusted once you get familiar with the boss. Using either an adrenaline urn or the persistent rage relic is highly recommended to stall adrenaline between kills. At the higher ends an adrenaline urn will start falling off generally around ~40+ kills per hour. Advanced Preset \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Essence of Finality Dark bow spec stored \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Persistent Rage Prevents adren loss after dropping combat \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Ancient elven ritual shard Restores prayer overtime, 5 minute cooldown What To Do Both players stand on the same square (DD or death dot) and don\u2019t move unless necessary. Activate your Anguish/Desolation and Soul Link prayers. The incite prays Protect from Melee and the DPS should pray Soul Split. The Soul Link curse splits both the damage taken and health healed between the two players which allows the incite to stay healthy while not moving, maintaining the stack and effectiveness of chins. When there are 2 or more brothers that would be affected by chins, use chins. If you are targeting just one brother, use your dual crossbows or 2h bow. Positioning The brothers starting positions change everyday, hence your starting position will also change. On each side, three brothers spawn on three seperate squares, spawning alphabetically going from North to South (A North, Z South). They will then aggro onto players, and the melee brothers will run to the players. Because the goal is to stack all brothers in chin radius, the strategy is generally to stand next to Ahrim or Karil and let the melee brothers run to you and stack on top of or next to Ahrim or Karil. Because AoE and stacking brothers is the most important part of getting efficient and fast kills, the incite should move as little as possible or else risk messing up the stack. When you need to move is determined by the daily rotation because each brother does different special attacks. Internalize the special attacks below then you can formulate your own plan of when to move based on the daily rotation. For instance, if it\u2019s ADG, you would only move from the starting spot if: (1) Karil drops a bomb that could damage you or your partner (2) Dharok or Guthan do a melee spin on your side (3) Ahrim specs and becomes unattackable, at which point you should run the brothers to stop taking damage. Only move when you see one of these things happening: Dharok The only Dharok spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Guthan Guthan can melee spin. Additionally, he can spear the DPS, at which point the DPS should move to stand MD of Guthan (if all brothers are stacked, as we don\u2019t want the Incite to move at all). Torag The only Torag spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Verac Verac does not spin. Nothing Verac does should force you to move. Ahrim Ahrim\u2019s firespin special attack can force you to move, but if you are immediately next to the rift in the center (as you are at the start of the fight), you won\u2019t take damage. Karil Karil is the most dangerous brother. His lightning, bomb, and firespin attacks can all force you to move. \u200e \u200eHis firespin attack is the same as Ahrim\u2019s - if you are next to the rift, you will take no damage. His bomb attack can force you to move whether or not Karil is on your side. If he is on your side, you should move as soon as you realize he has started a bomb special because he leaves a bomb in his place when he hops over. If he is not on your side, you should be aware of Karil bombing and move away from the bombs. Keep in mind that you can be damaged by bombs on the other side of the rift - so if he bombs while you are still in your starting position, you may still need to move away. If you are low on food or it\u2019s shadow realm, you need to move quickly. Rotations (Video Guides Courtesy of #Glenn) Notes \u2b25 If you have an offhand flanking you will need to 1 tick the switch in order to keep aftershock stacks. \u2b25 Because both players know what ability the other is doing at all times (at the start), the incite should walk any frag shots. They will need to walk under Ahrim in order to walk all three brothers\u2019 frag shots. For example, if it\u2019s A+2M (Ahrim plus two melee brothers), walk under Ahrim one tick after corrupting. \u2b25 Make sure your chins are hitting every brother. Chin abilities affect a 3x3 square centered around your target. That is, they will hit any enemy that is on or adjacent to the square you are targeting. Sometimes, brothers will spread around you and you will need to target the center brother instead of any brother that may be on the side. Ahrim + 2 Melee Auto \u2192 (Activate as snipe hits) \u2192 / \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Ahrim, because his name starts with A, will always start North. When there are two melee brothers combined with Ahrim, you should start the fight one square north of where he spawns if you are the the west side. On east side you should use the door method. If Ahrim is not aired and does a spec (very rare), the incite should start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks. Relure the brothers to Ahrim once he is done speccing. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=121 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=275 Karil + 2 Melee You will be skipping auto in order to burst down karil asap to avoid specs. However this will also mean that sometimes Karil might not be the first to die in which case the DPS has the option to replace snipe with greater ricochet. \u2192 (tc) + (Activate as snipe/needle hits) \u2192 \u2192 Improvise When K is mid, the incite for this side will start the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where Karil spawns to make sure none of the brothers end up behind you. \u200e \u200eIf Karil specs, start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks and relure them ASAP onto Karil when he is attackable. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=154 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=290 If K is south, the DPS stands 1 square south of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square south of where the middle brother spaws. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=174 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=308 If K is north, the DPS stands 1 square north of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square north of where the middle brother spawns. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=193 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=326 Triple Melee Auto \u2192 (Activate as snipe hits) \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Improvise The 3M incite always starts the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where middle brother spawns. In order to prevent aggro onto the DPSer, It is recommended that the incite wait until after his first bleed (Corruption Shot) to start running. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=249 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=390 AK (Middle) West (Surge rotation): ( ) Auto + + (During GCD) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Improvise East (Door rotation): ( ) Auto + + (Side step) \u2192 (tc) + \u2192 \u2192 Improvise With Karil as the middle brother it is possible to use the surge rotation on both west side. This implies that you stand on the \u200e \u200e2nd southern-most square on west along the rift. Both players will target Karil then Auto + ability > surge (mid GCD) > chins dbow > improvise. If you do not have a 9 tile range weapon you can do the intial auto + ability on the melee brother. If you are on the east side you will use the door method with a side step. This implies that you will start on the eastern tile and walk one tile west after auto + ability. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=231 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=342 AK (South) Start on the east tile infront of the door, after your Auto + bleed, walk one tile west.

With everyone chinning, the kill order is not as important as it used to be. If there is ever an opportunity to chin brothers, do so (and when chinning you cannot control, really, which brother takes the most damage). However, if brothers are not stacked for some reason (e.g running from a spec), then this order becomes important. Karil is the highest priority target because his specs are the most dangerous and most damaging. Torag is next because his hammer spec has a lot of KO potential if it ever occurs simultaneously with any other spec (spin, bomb, lightning, etc). Dharok is next because he hits hard when low HP and can prolong a kill if he does a Give Me Everything special. Guthan is slightly less annoying than Dharok. Ahrim and Verac do very little damage and have mundane specials, so they are last. How to Keep Track of Karil Karil is relatively dangerous, and it is possible to die because you didn\u2019t see Karil leaving a bomb in the pile. The most consistent way to know where Karil is speccing is to watch for changes in the soul split animation. When Karil flies away to do a spec, the cloud-like animations that travel between the player and target will often track with him. By watching the clouds, you can know if and where Karil is speccing. If they suddenly fly towards somewhere on your side, he\u2019s probably doing a firespin. If they fly towards one of the pillars on the chasm, it\u2019s probably a lightning attack (might still be a bomb!). If they fly somewhere to the other side, you know it\u2019s a bomb. This tip is useful for people on and opposite of Karil\u2019s side. Conserving Food \u2b25 Most importantly, learn to avoid special attacks and kill the brothers quickly. \u2b25 Perfect your surges and bladed dives in the tunnels \u2b25 Encourage your partners to save surge spots (see this guide: https://youtu.be/7OhoZcO2gXY ). \u2b25 Activate fortitude when you activate Excalibur. You\u2019ll heal about 30 more lp per Excalibur heal, and those extra lp will stick around after you deactivate fortitude.

Each side will have 3 brothers, the order of which changes everyday. However you will spend more time running through tunnels than you will actually fighting the brothers, which is why it is important to be proficient at both dps rotations and movement abilties i.e. surge + bladed dive. This is also why having the mobile perk, double surge and bladed dive unlocked is crucial for high kph. At RotS the meta is to AoE the brothers down as fast as possible. Most of the meta and strategy revolve around stacking and luring the brothers so that they can be killed at the same time. By far the best way to do this is to have everyone use mechanised chinchompas and have a Dark bow Essence of Finality. Chinchompas make almost all abilities AoE. In general, all three brothers on a side are stacked on top of each other and then taking advantage of chins AoE to kill them all. Well-executed, this strategy should result in consistent 15-20s kills on any rotation. Additionally, because the ability rotation is independent of the organization of the brothers, it is very consistent and easy to learn and perfect. Each RoTS kill is worth 1,065,448. Advanced players can get up to 46 kph, earning on average 49,010,611 gp/hr.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/rots/#presets","text":"Bladed dive is critical to being able to exit tunnels efficiently and increase KPH.

Activate your Anguish/Desolation and Soul Link prayers. The incite prays Protect from Melee and the DPS should pray Soul Split. The Soul Link curse splits both the damage taken and health healed between the two players which allows the incite to stay healthy while not moving, maintaining the stack and effectiveness of chins. When there are 2 or more brothers that would be affected by chins, use chins. If you are targeting just one brother, use your dual crossbows or 2h bow.","title":"What To Do"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/rots/#positioning","text":"The brothers starting positions change everyday, hence your starting position will also change. On each side, three brothers spawn on three seperate squares, spawning alphabetically going from North to South (A North, Z South). They will then aggro onto players, and the melee brothers will run to the players. Because the goal is to stack all brothers in chin radius, the strategy is generally to stand next to Ahrim or Karil and let the melee brothers run to you and stack on top of or next to Ahrim or Karil. Because AoE and stacking brothers is the most important part of getting efficient and fast kills, the incite should move as little as possible or else risk messing up the stack. When you need to move is determined by the daily rotation because each brother does different special attacks. Internalize the special attacks below then you can formulate your own plan of when to move based on the daily rotation. For instance, if it\u2019s ADG, you would only move from the starting spot if: (1) Karil drops a bomb that could damage you or your partner (2) Dharok or Guthan do a melee spin on your side (3) Ahrim specs and becomes unattackable, at which point you should run the brothers to stop taking damage. Only move when you see one of these things happening: Dharok The only Dharok spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Guthan Guthan can melee spin. Additionally, he can spear the DPS, at which point the DPS should move to stand MD of Guthan (if all brothers are stacked, as we don\u2019t want the Incite to move at all). Torag The only Torag spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Verac Verac does not spin. Nothing Verac does should force you to move. Ahrim Ahrim\u2019s firespin special attack can force you to move, but if you are immediately next to the rift in the center (as you are at the start of the fight), you won\u2019t take damage. Karil Karil is the most dangerous brother. His lightning, bomb, and firespin attacks can all force you to move. \u200e \u200eHis firespin attack is the same as Ahrim\u2019s - if you are next to the rift, you will take no damage. His bomb attack can force you to move whether or not Karil is on your side. If he is on your side, you should move as soon as you realize he has started a bomb special because he leaves a bomb in his place when he hops over. If he is not on your side, you should be aware of Karil bombing and move away from the bombs. Keep in mind that you can be damaged by bombs on the other side of the rift - so if he bombs while you are still in your starting position, you may still need to move away. If you are low on food or it\u2019s shadow realm, you need to move quickly.","title":"Positioning"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/rots/#rotations-video-guides-courtesy-of-glenn","text":"Notes \u2b25 If you have an offhand flanking you will need to 1 tick the switch in order to keep aftershock stacks. \u2b25 Because both players know what ability the other is doing at all times (at the start), the incite should walk any frag shots. They will need to walk under Ahrim in order to walk all three brothers\u2019 frag shots. For example, if it\u2019s A+2M (Ahrim plus two melee brothers), walk under Ahrim one tick after corrupting. \u2b25 Make sure your chins are hitting every brother. Chin abilities affect a 3x3 square centered around your target. That is, they will hit any enemy that is on or adjacent to the square you are targeting. Sometimes, brothers will spread around you and you will need to target the center brother instead of any brother that may be on the side. Ahrim + 2 Melee Auto \u2192 (Activate as snipe hits) \u2192 / \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Ahrim, because his name starts with A, will always start North. When there are two melee brothers combined with Ahrim, you should start the fight one square north of where he spawns if you are the the west side. On east side you should use the door method. If Ahrim is not aired and does a spec (very rare), the incite should start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks. Relure the brothers to Ahrim once he is done speccing. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=121 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=275 Karil + 2 Melee You will be skipping auto in order to burst down karil asap to avoid specs.

But, when you break it down into different pieces, it is fairly straight forward. One thing to note is that Yakamaru has a unique mechanic that gives it 100% hit accuracy. If Yaka were to splash, it will deal half damage instead. Keeping this in mind, keeping the appropriate prayers up (mage in md, ranged otherwise) is critical. During the entirety of the fight (including Mirage Phase), Yakamaru will add stacks towards its primary target. These stacks will allow Yakamaru to deal increased damage to anyone with these stacks. This mechanic can be dealt with using Freedom to halve the number of stacks that you have. Unlike AoD, these stacks will not reset your defensive abilities.

This preset ensures you don't stray too far away from the META strategies while at the same time giving you room to breathe in handling this type of basing. This preset also assumes you're camping Standards \u2b25 (Runes for and ) Roles North Tank Also known as NT or Sand Tank. This person must voke and tank the Sand pool during mirage. Since the DPS will be focused on the other 3 pools first, the NT will be tanking mirage for the longest amount of time. That being said, a defensive rotation is advised as well as using , , and shield dome as effectively as possible. A good way of dealing with this pool is using , then using once a good number of stacks are built in order to receive a good heal, then using and other defensive thresholds/ultimates as needed. Jelly Wrangler This person is to tag, voke and drag jellyfish away from the other players during mirage phase. A maximum number of 10 jellyfish can be present in the instance at one point. Using ice barrage is a good way of dealing with the jellyfish as it will affect multiple targets. Using melee prayer and \u200e \u200eis also critical in reducing damage taken. If enough jellyfish surround the JW, it is very easy to get KO'ed. Using defensives is crucial as killing jellyfish in your party will force Yakamaru to spawn another jellyfish near the team. Bolas can also be used if you are ranging. Main Stun Also known as MS. This person will stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool. It is important that this is the ONLY person who stuns the pool. It is also important to note that asphyxiate should NOT be used as main stun; impact/deep impact or their ranged/melee variants will be sufficient. Using stuns during this pool will deal 1000 typeless damage to the whole team and drastically reduce Yakamaru's defense. If another stun is used quickly, the typeless damage can hit up to 5000 typeless damage (in conjunction to the initial 1000). Back-up Stun: Also known as BUS. This person is to stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool ONLY if the MS misses their stun. If the MS misses their stun, they are to call out \"stun missed\", then the BUS will use a stun ability. Again, do NOT use asphyxiate to stun the pool. Double Also known as DBL. This person will act as a poison tank for Stun pool. During Sand pool, you will take the poison from sand (in conjunction with the PT). However, you will not run MD to Yakamaru during Sand pool. You will tank the poison from this point up until Stun pool is defeated. It is important to stand MD to Yakamaru during the entirety of Stun pool (pray mage) and to keep a high HP level as you will be getting hit by mage hits, poison hits, and the occasional stun hit. CPR This person must revive the PT after the pool is phased. The PT will show up on the beach and will have a bar over their head indicating how long you have to revive them. If you do not get to the PT before this bar is depleted, the PT will be instantly killed. Poison Tank Also known as PT. This person must tank the poison for each pool (except for Stun). At 100k HP, Yakamaru will release a poison to a random square and you will have a few seconds to be standing on this square. The designated tile will be at the center of four inward facing green arrows (this looks like detonate). Once you get the confirmation message that you have received the poison, you must rush into melee distance to Yakamaru (pray mage). Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, you will be taken to the beach (southeast area of the instance) and the CPR will revive you. Make sure to switch ranged prayer here. If the poison tank misses the poison or is not standing MD as the pool dies, the entire pool must be repeated. Stun 0 Also known as St0 or S0. This person must DPS the Stun pool during mirage. This person should also follow the same rotation as St5 but does not need to use any planks. This role is optional as the NT may act as a St0 (this should only be done if you are very experienced). Stun 5 Also known as St5 or S5. These 2 people must take 5 planks from the beach and DPS the Stun pool during mirage. A quick way of dealing with this is tagging the pool, \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200eon the pool. Once the pool flies into the air, you and your partner will close the pool with your 5 planks (together, 10 planks are used). Shark 10 Also known as Stag10, SH10, or S10. This person must voke and tank the Shark pool during mirage and then use 10 planks to cover the pool once Yakamaru is defeated. Since most of the DPS will be focused on the Shark pool during mirage, the SH10 will not have to rotate defensive abilities asides from devotion or debilitate. That being said, using devotion then building into / / , using an adrenaline renewal potion and doing a DPS rotation is advised. Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, it will jump into the air and the SH10 must close the pool with their 10 planks so the pool does not respawn. Mechanics Yakamaru has different mechanics based on the pool he is currently occupying (Choice of tendril, shark, sand, stun, and mid). Map of Yakamaru Pools Sand Pool This is the northwestern pool, it will always follow the shark pool unless Yakamaru dives to the sand pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Quick Sand\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will begin burying eight random players in the instance (or however many are in the instance minus 2, so if 8 remain, 6 will be affected). The two free players must click on the other players in order to free them from being isnta-killed. If the base tank is buried, they must be freed as soon as possible. Typically, the 2 unaffected players should free the player closest to them and then immediately free the base tank. If you are affected by the special attack, your defensive abilities (except freedom and anticipation) will be put on cooldown (you can still use Disruption Shield and Shield Dome). Furthermore, you will still be able to attack Yamaru even if you are affected by the Quick Sand attack. Keeping the special attack in mind, the team should be cautious with doing too much or too little DPS around 100k HP. If Yakamaru does the Quick Sand attack in conjunction to releasing the poison, the poison tank and double may not be able to get the poison in time. If Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack and the HP is slightly above 100k, the team should slow down on the DPS. If Yakamaru is close to 0 HP and the poison tank is in position to phase and Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack, the team should either phase ASAP or slow down. This ensures the CPR is free to save the poison tank from the insta-kill. Stun Pool This is the northeastern pool, it will always follow Sand Pool unless Yakamaru dives to Stun Pool first. During this pool, Yakamaru will not gain a special attack, but will gain a special mechanic. This means that Yakamaru's special attack rotation will be: 4 auto attacks, jellyfish, 4 auto attacks, blue, repeat. The unique mechanic that Yakamaru gains is a defensive buff. This buff increases as the fight progresses to the point where Yakamaru will become invulnerable to all attacks except to the style it is weak against. Yakamaru's weakness is indicated by its helmet's color (red for melee, green for ranged, blue for mage) or the text next to Yakamaru's name. This mechanic is bypassed by using a stun ability to drastically lower Yakamaru's defense. Stuns that will proc this are: asphyxiate, deep impact, impact, horror, shock, tight bindings, rout, binding shot, demoralise, destroy, stomp, forceful backhand, backhand, and kick. Dreapnips and dominion tower gloves will not stun the pool. Once a stun is used, Yakamaru will reflect damage to the team, the damage reflected can be anywhere between 1000-5000 damage. This damage scales to Yakamaru's current defense. If Yakamaru has a very high defense and a stun is used, the damage reflected will be closer to 1000. If Yakamaru has a low defense or was recently stunned, the damage will be closer to 5000. If two players stun Yakamaru at the same time, the typeless damage will stack, meaning the team will instantly be hit for 6000 damage. Once Yakamaru is stunned, you should use high hitting abilities and thresholds like snapshot/wild magic/hurricane and use sacrifice (as it can hit up to 10k during this time). Using soulsplit during these thresholds is also advised as it will drastically cut down on food usage if done properly. If your double has done their role properly, you do not need to slow down around 100k HP as you will already have a poison tank ready. A fast way to do this pool is to have everyone heal to full HP and build to full adrenaline, have someone stun, then use onslaught at the same time. If executed properly, this will cut down on kill time fairly noticeably. Shark Pool This is the western most pool, it will always follow the tendril pool unless Yakamaru dives to shark pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Sharknado\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will shroud itself in a Sharknado and, after a few attacks, will release the sharks. These sharks will land around Yakamaru and at the feet of every player in the fight. To avoid tanking the ~2 thousand+ typeless damage, you must surge/escape/bladed dive away from the sharks or kick them away. It is highly recommended to surge/escape/bladed dive away as you may kick a shark into the DPS pile. It is very important to note that the sharks will trail you until they land on the ground, meaning that escaping too early will cause a shark to land at your feet and hit you (and other DPS who are near you). One method of dealing with this is having the DPS death dot next to the Tendril pool (southern pool) during this special attack. Only a single shark will land next to the death dot and can easily be kicked away. This method requires extensive communication and is not advised. Immediately after the sharks land, a jellyfish will spawn (as four auto-attacks will have passed). Since the team will be spread out, make sure to bind the jellyfish so that it does not attack the base tank or the DPS pile. As poison tank, it is important to note that there may be more than one shark at your feet as the poison is released. It is advised to bring bladed dive in order to escape from the sharks, dive to the poison, then barge to pool in the event that the \"Sharknado\" special is unleashed as poison is released. Tendril Pool The southern most pool is referred to the \"tendril pool\". In this pool, Yaka will still use the Jellyfish and Blue attacks, but will also use two more mechanics. In this pool, it is imperative that the base tank is the first person who tags the pool, otherwise Yakamaru may unleash a \"Tendril\" special attack into the DPS pile that will deal rapid typeless damage. The special attack order will always follow this: jellyfish, blue, pool special. For the southern pool, the tendril special attack will be the third special. Keeping this in mind, it is possible to use resonance on every single jellyfish spawn outside of middle pool (assuming you tag the jellyfish and Yakamaru does not snipe your res) and maintain a high HP level without eating. The tank will deal with a tendril that will shoot up from the ground and deal rapid typeless damage. This can be negated by using barricade or stepping away from the tendril. The DPS will deal with a \"choke\". This choke will deal small amounts of typeless damage that will affect the top 5 DPSers. The DPS can negate this special attack by doing more damage to Yakamaru. If the DPS does not do enough damage to Yakamaru during the special attack, the choke will deal increasing amounts of damage (up to 2000). Freedom will not clear this (defensives are reset by this special attack). If the poison is released when the top 5 DPSers are choked, you should be prepared to take the poison for this pool and tank it. This is more of a courtesy towards your group and you should indicate if you are covering the role to avoid confusion. As the poison tank, you should be prepared to barge into Yakamaru immediately after receiving the poison to avoid the possibility of being choked outside of melee distance. Make sure you pray magic while standing in melee distance and eat as necessary as the poison will hit you for fairly high damage and cannot be negated by venomblood or antipoison. Mirage Phase After all 4 pools have been completed, there will be 20 planks on the beach (to the southeast) and a number of jellyfish around Yakamaru. At this point, the SH10 and two St5's should get their planks and position themselves near their pools. The NT and Base Tank should also position themselves near their pools as the phase continues. Ideally, the St5's, the St0, NT, and JW should stand to the north of the middle pool. The SH10 and the free DPS should stand to the west of the middle pool. The base tank should stand south of the middle pool. Once the middle pool hits 50k HP, mirage will begin. Each pool will only have 150k HP. The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. Stun Pool (Mirage) The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. The NT should then move to the north of the Sand pool and the St5's and St0 should move to Shark pool. Shark Pool The SH10 should be positioned to the south of the pool. They will tag the pool, voke, use devotion, build to 100% and then do a DPS rotation. The four free DPS should move to the east of the pool and also do a DPS rotation. If the DPS is optimal, Yakamaru will only unleash two special attacks. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the SH10 will use all 10 planks to cover the pool and then use freedom to halve the number of aggression stacks they have. The SH10 and free DPS should then remain in their sunshines/death's swiftnesses and attack Tendril pool. If the DPS is not sufficient, the SH10 should use resonance, freedom, then rotate defensives to reduce incoming damage. The incoming DPS from the St5's and St0 should be enough and the pool should close. Tendril Pool The Base Tank will be south east of the Tendril Pool and must tank the pool until after Shark Pool is finished. The special attack rotation will remain the same, meaning the Base Tank's rotation should remain the same. Once Shark Pool is closed, the DPS will focus on Tendril Pool and it should be closed before anyone is choked. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the DPS and Base Tank MUST spam click on the pool in order to add buckets of sand and close the pool. Every player can only add 2 buckets of sand, meaning a minimum of 5 people are needed to close the pool on the first try. If the pool isn't closed in time, it must be repeated. If the pool is repeated, the Base Tank must provoke the pool off the DPS or risk having a tendril spawn in the DPS pile. It is important to note that buckets of sand added to the pool during previous attempts will carry over. This means if 6 buckets of sand are added during the first attempt, only 4 buckets of sand are needed to close the pool on the next attempt. Once the pool is over, everyone becomes DPS and moves to Sand pool. Sand Pool The NT will be north of the pool and be tanking auto attacks. Since no one else from the team should be near the pool (until Tendril is defeated), Yakamaru will not use the blue special attack or the Quick Sand attack. However, Jellyfish can still spawn during this pool and will be a problem. You can use stuns/binds/entangle/bolas to deal with Jellyfish, though your JW SHOULD be keeping those off the NT. Once the DPS comes to finish Sand pool, you need to be cautious of the Quick Sand attack. If your NT was rotating DPS rotations during their Barricade/Devotion, the pool should be finished quickly. When the pool hits 0 HP, the team should spam click on the pool and fill it with 10 buckets of sand. If the team is affected by the Quick Sand attack as the pool hits 0 HP, you won't be able to fill the pool with 10 buckets of sand and will be forced to repeat the pool. Mid Pool The Base Tank will tag, provoke, then run west to tank the middle pool after mirage. The DPS should use thresholds and dump their adrenaline as the pool will only have 50k HP. The JW should keep their Jellyfish away from the team during this last portion of the fight The middle pool will utilize the \"jellyfish attack\" and the \"blue\". It is important to note that Yakmaru will use four auto attacks before using a special attack. The jellyfish attack will spawn a jellyfish in the arena and five holes will spawn around it. After a few seconds, the holes will shoot water up and damage everyone standing on them for about two thousand damage. This damage can be negated using resonance or simply standing off of them. What is important to note is that every person who \"tanks\" this special attack by standing on the holes will deal 10 thousand damage to the jellyfish. This means that only five people need to stand on the holes in order to kill the jellyfish. An easy way to deal with this mechanic is to use binding shot (or entangle) on the jellyfish, equip a shield, and use resonance. You can switch to soulsplit and use piercing shot (or wrack/slice) to deal extra damage and finish off the jellyfish. If the mechanic is ignored entirely, the jellyfish will deal quick melee hits to everyone around it. The middle pool will utilize the \"jellyfish attack\" and the \"blue\". It is important to note that Yakmaru will use four auto attacks before using a special attack.

But, when you break it down into different pieces, it is fairly straight forward. One thing to note is that Yakamaru has a unique mechanic that gives it 100% hit accuracy. If Yaka were to splash, it will deal half damage instead. Keeping this in mind, keeping the appropriate prayers up (mage in md, ranged otherwise) is critical. During the entirety of the fight (including Mirage Phase), Yakamaru will add stacks towards its primary target. These stacks will allow Yakamaru to deal increased damage to anyone with these stacks. This mechanic can be dealt with using Freedom to halve the number of stacks that you have. Unlike AoD, these stacks will not reset your defensive abilities.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/yakamaru/#drops","text":"\u2b25 \u200e \u200e Yakamaru's helmet 1/300 (60 threshold)","title":"Drops"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/yakamaru/#presets","text":"DPS \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) DPS \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Off-hand Ascension crossbow Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) DPS \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Off-hand Drygore mace Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) North Tank Ancients are recommended to freeze any jelly that spawns on you, while its common to have a JW to deal with them, it's also not uncommon to just let jellies spawn and the team itself works as a whole to prevent their movement. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Base Tank on Ripper Achto used for defensive resets, arcane used for damage reduction if needed at any point.

This person must voke and tank the Sand pool during mirage. Since the DPS will be focused on the other 3 pools first, the NT will be tanking mirage for the longest amount of time. That being said, a defensive rotation is advised as well as using , , and shield dome as effectively as possible. A good way of dealing with this pool is using , then using once a good number of stacks are built in order to receive a good heal, then using and other defensive thresholds/ultimates as needed. Jelly Wrangler This person is to tag, voke and drag jellyfish away from the other players during mirage phase. A maximum number of 10 jellyfish can be present in the instance at one point. Using ice barrage is a good way of dealing with the jellyfish as it will affect multiple targets. Using melee prayer and \u200e \u200eis also critical in reducing damage taken. If enough jellyfish surround the JW, it is very easy to get KO'ed. Using defensives is crucial as killing jellyfish in your party will force Yakamaru to spawn another jellyfish near the team. Bolas can also be used if you are ranging. Main Stun Also known as MS. This person will stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool. It is important that this is the ONLY person who stuns the pool. It is also important to note that asphyxiate should NOT be used as main stun; impact/deep impact or their ranged/melee variants will be sufficient. Using stuns during this pool will deal 1000 typeless damage to the whole team and drastically reduce Yakamaru's defense. If another stun is used quickly, the typeless damage can hit up to 5000 typeless damage (in conjunction to the initial 1000). Back-up Stun: Also known as BUS. This person is to stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool ONLY if the MS misses their stun. If the MS misses their stun, they are to call out \"stun missed\", then the BUS will use a stun ability. Again, do NOT use asphyxiate to stun the pool. Double Also known as DBL. This person will act as a poison tank for Stun pool. During Sand pool, you will take the poison from sand (in conjunction with the PT). However, you will not run MD to Yakamaru during Sand pool. You will tank the poison from this point up until Stun pool is defeated. It is important to stand MD to Yakamaru during the entirety of Stun pool (pray mage) and to keep a high HP level as you will be getting hit by mage hits, poison hits, and the occasional stun hit. CPR This person must revive the PT after the pool is phased. The PT will show up on the beach and will have a bar over their head indicating how long you have to revive them. If you do not get to the PT before this bar is depleted, the PT will be instantly killed. Poison Tank Also known as PT. This person must tank the poison for each pool (except for Stun). At 100k HP, Yakamaru will release a poison to a random square and you will have a few seconds to be standing on this square. The designated tile will be at the center of four inward facing green arrows (this looks like detonate). Once you get the confirmation message that you have received the poison, you must rush into melee distance to Yakamaru (pray mage). Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, you will be taken to the beach (southeast area of the instance) and the CPR will revive you. Make sure to switch ranged prayer here. If the poison tank misses the poison or is not standing MD as the pool dies, the entire pool must be repeated. Stun 0 Also known as St0 or S0. This person must DPS the Stun pool during mirage. This person should also follow the same rotation as St5 but does not need to use any planks. This role is optional as the NT may act as a St0 (this should only be done if you are very experienced). Stun 5 Also known as St5 or S5. These 2 people must take 5 planks from the beach and DPS the Stun pool during mirage. A quick way of dealing with this is tagging the pool, \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200eon the pool. Once the pool flies into the air, you and your partner will close the pool with your 5 planks (together, 10 planks are used). Shark 10 Also known as Stag10, SH10, or S10. This person must voke and tank the Shark pool during mirage and then use 10 planks to cover the pool once Yakamaru is defeated. Since most of the DPS will be focused on the Shark pool during mirage, the SH10 will not have to rotate defensive abilities asides from devotion or debilitate. That being said, using devotion then building into / / , using an adrenaline renewal potion and doing a DPS rotation is advised. Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, it will jump into the air and the SH10 must close the pool with their 10 planks so the pool does not respawn.","title":"Roles"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/yakamaru/#mechanics","text":"Yakamaru has different mechanics based on the pool he is currently occupying (Choice of tendril, shark, sand, stun, and mid). Map of Yakamaru Pools Sand Pool This is the northwestern pool, it will always follow the shark pool unless Yakamaru dives to the sand pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Quick Sand\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will begin burying eight random players in the instance (or however many are in the instance minus 2, so if 8 remain, 6 will be affected). The two free players must click on the other players in order to free them from being isnta-killed. If the base tank is buried, they must be freed as soon as possible. Typically, the 2 unaffected players should free the player closest to them and then immediately free the base tank. If you are affected by the special attack, your defensive abilities (except freedom and anticipation) will be put on cooldown (you can still use Disruption Shield and Shield Dome). Furthermore, you will still be able to attack Yamaru even if you are affected by the Quick Sand attack. Keeping the special attack in mind, the team should be cautious with doing too much or too little DPS around 100k HP. If Yakamaru does the Quick Sand attack in conjunction to releasing the poison, the poison tank and double may not be able to get the poison in time. If Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack and the HP is slightly above 100k, the team should slow down on the DPS. If Yakamaru is close to 0 HP and the poison tank is in position to phase and Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack, the team should either phase ASAP or slow down. This ensures the CPR is free to save the poison tank from the insta-kill. Stun Pool This is the northeastern pool, it will always follow Sand Pool unless Yakamaru dives to Stun Pool first. During this pool, Yakamaru will not gain a special attack, but will gain a special mechanic. This means that Yakamaru's special attack rotation will be: 4 auto attacks, jellyfish, 4 auto attacks, blue, repeat. The unique mechanic that Yakamaru gains is a defensive buff. This buff increases as the fight progresses to the point where Yakamaru will become invulnerable to all attacks except to the style it is weak against. Yakamaru's weakness is indicated by its helmet's color (red for melee, green for ranged, blue for mage) or the text next to Yakamaru's name. This mechanic is bypassed by using a stun ability to drastically lower Yakamaru's defense. Stuns that will proc this are: asphyxiate, deep impact, impact, horror, shock, tight bindings, rout, binding shot, demoralise, destroy, stomp, forceful backhand, backhand, and kick. Dreapnips and dominion tower gloves will not stun the pool. Once a stun is used, Yakamaru will reflect damage to the team, the damage reflected can be anywhere between 1000-5000 damage. This damage scales to Yakamaru's current defense. If Yakamaru has a very high defense and a stun is used, the damage reflected will be closer to 1000. If Yakamaru has a low defense or was recently stunned, the damage will be closer to 5000. If two players stun Yakamaru at the same time, the typeless damage will stack, meaning the team will instantly be hit for 6000 damage. Once Yakamaru is stunned, you should use high hitting abilities and thresholds like snapshot/wild magic/hurricane and use sacrifice (as it can hit up to 10k during this time). Using soulsplit during these thresholds is also advised as it will drastically cut down on food usage if done properly. If your double has done their role properly, you do not need to slow down around 100k HP as you will already have a poison tank ready. A fast way to do this pool is to have everyone heal to full HP and build to full adrenaline, have someone stun, then use onslaught at the same time. If executed properly, this will cut down on kill time fairly noticeably. Shark Pool This is the western most pool, it will always follow the tendril pool unless Yakamaru dives to shark pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Sharknado\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will shroud itself in a Sharknado and, after a few attacks, will release the sharks. These sharks will land around Yakamaru and at the feet of every player in the fight. To avoid tanking the ~2 thousand+ typeless damage, you must surge/escape/bladed dive away from the sharks or kick them away. It is highly recommended to surge/escape/bladed dive away as you may kick a shark into the DPS pile. It is very important to note that the sharks will trail you until they land on the ground, meaning that escaping too early will cause a shark to land at your feet and hit you (and other DPS who are near you). One method of dealing with this is having the DPS death dot next to the Tendril pool (southern pool) during this special attack. Only a single shark will land next to the death dot and can easily be kicked away. This method requires extensive communication and is not advised. Immediately after the sharks land, a jellyfish will spawn (as four auto-attacks will have passed). Since the team will be spread out, make sure to bind the jellyfish so that it does not attack the base tank or the DPS pile. As poison tank, it is important to note that there may be more than one shark at your feet as the poison is released. It is advised to bring bladed dive in order to escape from the sharks, dive to the poison, then barge to pool in the event that the \"Sharknado\" special is unleashed as poison is released. Tendril Pool The southern most pool is referred to the \"tendril pool\". In this pool, Yaka will still use the Jellyfish and Blue attacks, but will also use two more mechanics. In this pool, it is imperative that the base tank is the first person who tags the pool, otherwise Yakamaru may unleash a \"Tendril\" special attack into the DPS pile that will deal rapid typeless damage. The special attack order will always follow this: jellyfish, blue, pool special. For the southern pool, the tendril special attack will be the third special. Keeping this in mind, it is possible to use resonance on every single jellyfish spawn outside of middle pool (assuming you tag the jellyfish and Yakamaru does not snipe your res) and maintain a high HP level without eating. The tank will deal with a tendril that will shoot up from the ground and deal rapid typeless damage. This can be negated by using barricade or stepping away from the tendril. The DPS will deal with a \"choke\". This choke will deal small amounts of typeless damage that will affect the top 5 DPSers. The DPS can negate this special attack by doing more damage to Yakamaru. If the DPS does not do enough damage to Yakamaru during the special attack, the choke will deal increasing amounts of damage (up to 2000). Freedom will not clear this (defensives are reset by this special attack). If the poison is released when the top 5 DPSers are choked, you should be prepared to take the poison for this pool and tank it. This is more of a courtesy towards your group and you should indicate if you are covering the role to avoid confusion. As the poison tank, you should be prepared to barge into Yakamaru immediately after receiving the poison to avoid the possibility of being choked outside of melee distance. Make sure you pray magic while standing in melee distance and eat as necessary as the poison will hit you for fairly high damage and cannot be negated by venomblood or antipoison. Mirage Phase After all 4 pools have been completed, there will be 20 planks on the beach (to the southeast) and a number of jellyfish around Yakamaru. At this point, the SH10 and two St5's should get their planks and position themselves near their pools. The NT and Base Tank should also position themselves near their pools as the phase continues. Ideally, the St5's, the St0, NT, and JW should stand to the north of the middle pool. The SH10 and the free DPS should stand to the west of the middle pool. The base tank should stand south of the middle pool. Once the middle pool hits 50k HP, mirage will begin. Each pool will only have 150k HP. The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. Stun Pool (Mirage) The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. The NT should then move to the north of the Sand pool and the St5's and St0 should move to Shark pool. Shark Pool The SH10 should be positioned to the south of the pool. They will tag the pool, voke, use devotion, build to 100% and then do a DPS rotation. The four free DPS should move to the east of the pool and also do a DPS rotation. If the DPS is optimal, Yakamaru will only unleash two special attacks. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the SH10 will use all 10 planks to cover the pool and then use freedom to halve the number of aggression stacks they have. The SH10 and free DPS should then remain in their sunshines/death's swiftnesses and attack Tendril pool. If the DPS is not sufficient, the SH10 should use resonance, freedom, then rotate defensives to reduce incoming damage. The incoming DPS from the St5's and St0 should be enough and the pool should close. Tendril Pool The Base Tank will be south east of the Tendril Pool and must tank the pool until after Shark Pool is finished. The special attack rotation will remain the same, meaning the Base Tank's rotation should remain the same. Once Shark Pool is closed, the DPS will focus on Tendril Pool and it should be closed before anyone is choked. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the DPS and Base Tank MUST spam click on the pool in order to add buckets of sand and close the pool. Every player can only add 2 buckets of sand, meaning a minimum of 5 people are needed to close the pool on the first try. If the pool isn't closed in time, it must be repeated. If the pool is repeated, the Base Tank must provoke the pool off the DPS or risk having a tendril spawn in the DPS pile. It is important to note that buckets of sand added to the pool during previous attempts will carry over. This means if 6 buckets of sand are added during the first attempt, only 4 buckets of sand are needed to close the pool on the next attempt. Once the pool is over, everyone becomes DPS and moves to Sand pool. Sand Pool The NT will be north of the pool and be tanking auto attacks. Since no one else from the team should be near the pool (until Tendril is defeated), Yakamaru will not use the blue special attack or the Quick Sand attack. However, Jellyfish can still spawn during this pool and will be a problem. You can use stuns/binds/entangle/bolas to deal with Jellyfish, though your JW SHOULD be keeping those off the NT. Once the DPS comes to finish Sand pool, you need to be cautious of the Quick Sand attack. If your NT was rotating DPS rotations during their Barricade/Devotion, the pool should be finished quickly. When the pool hits 0 HP, the team should spam click on the pool and fill it with 10 buckets of sand. If the team is affected by the Quick Sand attack as the pool hits 0 HP, you won't be able to fill the pool with 10 buckets of sand and will be forced to repeat the pool. Mid Pool The Base Tank will tag, provoke, then run west to tank the middle pool after mirage. The DPS should use thresholds and dump their adrenaline as the pool will only have 50k HP. The JW should keep their Jellyfish away from the team during this last portion of the fight The middle pool will utilize the \"jellyfish attack\" and the \"blue\". It is important to note that Yakmaru will use four auto attacks before using a special attack. The jellyfish attack will spawn a jellyfish in the arena and five holes will spawn around it. After a few seconds, the holes will shoot water up and damage everyone standing on them for about two thousand damage. This damage can be negated using resonance or simply standing off of them. What is important to note is that every person who \"tanks\" this special attack by standing on the holes will deal 10 thousand damage to the jellyfish. This means that only five people need to stand on the holes in order to kill the jellyfish. An easy way to deal with this mechanic is to use binding shot (or entangle) on the jellyfish, equip a shield, and use resonance. You can switch to soulsplit and use piercing shot (or wrack/slice) to deal extra damage and finish off the jellyfish.

A Master tier player is expected to perform the strategies listed below in their submission. An Adept tier player is expected to attempt the majority of the listed strategies in their submission.

If you followed the lore behind the quest, you will understand why summoning familiars cannot be used at the boss, meaning that you can only use the items in your inventory. A legendary pet can be used here. Furthermore, any weapon that isn't a spear will deal half damage, meaning that melee is the only style you should use. Drops The droprate for obtaining a sigil is 1/512 . If a player rolls the sigil drop table, there is a 1/5 chance of Arcane, 1/5 chance of Divine, 1/5 chance of Elysian, and 2/5 chance of Spectral. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Spirit shield 1/64 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Holy elixir 1/171 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Spectral sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Arcane sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Divine sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Elysian sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Corporeal bone 1/2500 (500 threshold) Presets General As stated before, any weapon that isn't a spear will deal half damage, so melee is the only style that should be used at this boss. If you don't have a T92 spear then Reaper necklace is greatly preferred over the amulet of souls, as you do not have 100% hit chance. The Masuta's Warspear does work at Corporeal Beast (tested on approximately 200+ kills) and may be used in a solo situation as you will not have to prayer flick for melee swipes, however this is less optimal. Advanced Melee Preset Weapon poison will stack with the cinderbanes effect. A vampyrism scrimshaw will help sustain longer trips, and a cannon can be used for extra damage output (kinetic cyclone is used over coil as it does more damage, albeit at the cost of range). Jellyfish and brews can be used for general healing without adrenaline loss. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Mechanics Auto Attacks The Corporeal Beast will attack with only magic attacks if you are outside of melee distance. If you are within melee distance, the boss will use both melee and magic. Melee swipes are noticeable when the boss swipes with its front two legs. Also, protection prayers will not halve incoming damage, instead only partially reducing damage. \u2b25 Magic attacks will do an AOE splash on their target in a 3x3 square. This means you should stand at least 2 squares away from your partner(s), if applicable. Core Occasionally, a dark core will spawn and jump towards its target. This dark core will do constant typeless damage and will heal the boss unless it is killed or you step away from it. It will do typeless hits unless you are more than 1 square away. Advanced Corp Killing Strat (~100 kph if done well) Misc Things to Have Legendary pet for picking items (do not add a familiar, just summon the legendary pet), cannon with autorefill, disruption shield, ZGS spec. None of these are mandatory, but will noticeably increase kills/hr. Not owning a ZGS probably lowers kph by around 10. Corp is an outdated boss with slow spawn times, thanks to it having an easily accessible public instance you can abuse and this is what the method is based on. Kills will be alternated between the public and private instances.

It is done in these steps: Run out of md Cast the dw ability you want to use and click the ground Equip your spear and click corp (you only use Decimate and gFlurry ).

Video Example https://youtu.be/AaRA-nh6eM4 (2 kill example) https://youtu.be/Zfxg3dxf_pA (84 kph pace) Tips/Notes \u2b25 Since the kills are so fast, you can leave the non-instanced loot on the ground every other kill. When Corp dies, call your legendary pet and renew cannon (if needed) and exit. You can leave the loot on the ground in the world instance and every other kill you can go loot the old loot along with the new and leave. \u2b25 For instanced kills, you let your pet pick up the loot. After it has visually taken the loot, you wait 2-4 ticks and click exit (1 tick before it's in your inventory, you can leave and still get it). \u2b25 During an hour you should bank twice. This method is recommended to everyone intending to do Corp even if you aren't the most experienced player, since this just kills most of the waiting time essentially increasing your efficiency. \u2b25 The dark core doesn't use up your disruption shield , so you can camp with it even if the core is on you.

Completing the fight rewards you with BIS cape for all three styles. All of the gear and inventories can get switched around based on what you have and how experienced you are. For less experienced people keep the obsidian armour and bring more brews and solids with the best tier of weapon you have.

Presets General Tips \u2b25 The recommended method of killing Gregorovic involves using a halberd range weapon, such as a scythe, and toggling run off. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand at least 2 squares away (max halberd range) \u2b25 Stand in the Northwest Corner of the arena, and pot up, waiting for Gregorovic to spawn and walk over to you and DPS him down, handling mechanics as they come up. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Summon spirits can be ignored as with this positioning, he will absorb the poisoning spirit, which has no effect due to the immunity provided by incense sticks. \u2b25 A Scrimshaw of Vampyrism is used for extra sustain coupled with an is used to increase the effectiveness of Protection prayers, making the fight easier. Advanced Melee Preset Note: Everything displayed can be upgraded or downgraded as available. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Enhanced Luck Potion Gives tier 3 luck, can be removed if swapping to lotd \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Ancient Elven Ritual Shard Restores prayer overtime, 5 minute cooldown \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for and ) Note: it is highly recommended to use Irit Incense Sticks at maximum potency, as it will nullify his poison mechanics entirely. Mechanics Attack Rotation 3 Autos \u2192 Bouncing Blade \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Summon Spirits \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Shadow Spots \u2192 Repeat Bouncing Blade The first special attack occurs after 3 autos and he will throw a blade that bounces between you, other players if available, and then himself (it will not damage him), it will hit players 3 times, whether thats one player 3 times or 3 players 1 time each. Summon Spirits He will summon a spirit dependent on the area of the room that he's standing in, that will walk towards him. If it reaches melee distance of him it will be consumed granting Greg a buff based on the spirit summoned. \u200e \u200eThe ghosts that are summoned are the spirts of Mania, Rage, and Delirium. \u2b25 Spirit of Mania - connecting causes his attack speed to increase. \u2b25 Spirit of Rage - connecting with him causes his damage to increase. \u2b25 Spirit of Delirium - connecting causes his poison damage to increase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If using Venomblood as advised you can entirely ignore this spirit. By standing in the northwest corner he will only spawn this spirit. Shadow Spots Finally he will do a shadow spot attack similar to the twin furies, certain areas are marked with shadows that you must move out of to avoid a large mage hit, they come in small clusters with one being directly on the spot you are standing on and a few nearby. Clones At 140k health he will summon 2 clones, and at 60k he will summon 3 clones, they have 3k health each and Greg may teleport to them at random. AFK Melee Strategy (~41-44 kph) (Courtesy of #FriggityFrank and \u200e \u200e#Mia Groves) Gp/hr Total 13,647,878 Note: Assumes Max Reputation and 40 kph. Explanation \u2b25 This method will net a lower amount of kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put in high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. \u2b25 It is very effective for title/pet hunting however there are a few prerequisites in order to sustain yourself. \u2b25 It is important to pray and use a Superior/Scrimshaw of Vampyrism as this method relies on constant healing. \u2b25 Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you have to pay more attention to prayer points between kills. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but can be a slightly unsafe without a Superior Scrimshaw of Vampyrism. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you lose both the afk-ness of Penance and the safety net that Vampyrism provides. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not use Berserker for afking, as it will get you killed very easily. \u2b25 Either a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation or a Laniakea's Spear will be most effective for this method. Average kill times vary very little between them. Mandatory requirements \u2b25 This setup should reliably allow you to afk Gregorovic, with the duration between checking your status dependent on the aura you are using. However, the following needs to be done or else This method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners will result in failure: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Soulsplit is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Turmoil or Malevolence is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Superior/Vampyrism Scrimshaw is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Elder Overload is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Poison is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Poison protection / is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cinderbane Gloves are equipped \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blood Reaver is summoned \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run is on \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Auto-retaliate is on Preset \u2b25 Persistent Rage Relic - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an Adrenaline Urn with ocassional stalling. Not required if using 0% start bar. \u2b25 Irit Incense Sticks - Provide antipoison against Gregorovic. Not needed if using Venomblood perk on your armor. \u2b25 Kwuarm Incense Sticks - Provide extra poison damage. \u2b25 Essence of Finality - Saradomin Godsword stored. Emergency special attack if you're really low on health when you look back to your screen. Accuracy bonus helps when using Laniakea's Spear Action Bar - Masterwork Spear of Annihilation (Updated by #Mia Groves) \u2b25 This action bar is what you should use if you are using a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation . It puts more focus on bleeds to capitalize on the spear's passive ability. Debilitate is also used because it is less reliable to get heals out of AoE abilities like Quake and Hurricane. Generally, this bar will be lower KPH but higher survivability regardless of aura choice. Action Bar - Laniakea's Spear \u2b25 This action bar should be used with Laniakea's Spear . It has a more offensive focus and utilizes frequent AoE usage to heal off of minions rather than using Debilitate. Quake also sees higher usage to help mitigate the spear's accuracy issues. Due to the nature of this action bar, Trimmed Masterwork Armor is recommended to help mitigate burst damage from Greg. It is not necessary, but it helps with survivability. 0% Adrenaline Bar - Laniakea's Spear \u2b25 This action bar can be used instead of the one listed above when not using Adrenaline Retention effects. This allows the user to maintain similar afk kill speeds, but foregoes some safety. Please bear in mind that Debilitate is not used, so be wary if not using a Superior Vampyrism Scrimshaw or the Vampyrism Aura . It is highly recommended to turn on the Auto-Regenerate combat setting while using this bar. AFK Ranged Strategy (~44-47 kph) (Courtesy of #FriggityFrank) Gp/hr Total 15,012,666 Note: Assumes Max Reputation and 44 kph. Explanation \u2b25 This method will net a higher amount of kills per compared to the melee AFK setup, but has a much higher startup cost . However, the upkeep cost is significantly cheaper when compared to the melee setup. \u2b25 While faster, sometimes you will need to move to collect your loot. As you won't be constantly close to Gregorovic, loot will often drop outside of your area-loot range. Playing on mobile mitigates the need to move due to a larger area loot radius. \u2b25 It is important to pray as this method relies on constant healing. \u2b25 Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience and is very safe to use. HP may fluctuate an uncomfortable amount, but you generally heal enough to be more than safe enough, and helps maximise the usefulness of your Blood Reaver. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dark Magic provides extra damage, but similarly to Vampyrism you must pay more attention to prayer points. This should be the most effective aura for fast kills, but is the least afk choice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not give any extra poison procs. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you may cap out your HP often and not be able to actually heal. This reduces the effectiveness of your Blood Reaver. You also need to pay more attention to your prayer between kills. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not use Reckless for afking, as it will get you killed very easily. \u2b25 A Wyvern Crossbow will be one of the most effective weapons for this setup due to its passive. If you do not have one, other 2-handed range weapons should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower. Mandatory requirements \u2b25 This setup should reliably allow you to afk Gregorovic, with the duration between checking your status dependent on the aura you are using. However, the following needs to be done or else This method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners will result in failure: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You are standing 1 step out of melee distance of Greg's spawn point \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Adrenaline retention is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Greater Ricochet and Salt the Wound are unlocked \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Caroming 4 is on your weapon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Soulsplit is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Anguish or Desolation is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Elder Overload is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Poison is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Poison protection / is active \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cinderbane Gloves are equipped \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blood Reaver is summoned \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Auto-retaliate is on \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You are outside of melee distance Preset \u2b25 Persistent Rage Relic - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an Adrenaline Urn with ocassional stalling. \u2b25 Irit Incense Sticks - Provide antipoison against Gregorovic. Not needed if using Venomblood perk on your armor. \u2b25 Kwuarm Incense Sticks - Provide extra poison damage. \u2b25 Essence of Finality - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and Soulsplit passive. \u2b25 Reaver's Ring - Extra critical chance helps speed up kills. If not owned, can be substituted for other strong rings such as Asylum Surgeon's or Ring of Death. \u2b25 Book of Balance - Decent passive pocket item, provides extra poison procs and damage when activated. Reflecting Blood Essence can be used as a budget alternative. Action Bar 0% Adrenaline Action Bar \u2b25 This action bar can be used instead of the one listed above when not using Adrenaline Retention effects. This allows the user to afk with Ranged and benefit from lower supply costs.

They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you have to pay more attention to prayer points between kills. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but can be a slightly unsafe without a Superior Scrimshaw of Vampyrism. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you lose both the afk-ness of Penance and the safety net that Vampyrism provides. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not use Berserker for afking, as it will get you killed very easily. \u2b25 Either a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation or a Laniakea's Spear will be most effective for this method.

Emergency special attack if you're really low on health when you look back to your screen. Accuracy bonus helps when using Laniakea's Spear Action Bar - Masterwork Spear of Annihilation (Updated by #Mia Groves) \u2b25 This action bar is what you should use if you are using a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation . It puts more focus on bleeds to capitalize on the spear's passive ability. Debilitate is also used because it is less reliable to get heals out of AoE abilities like Quake and Hurricane. Generally, this bar will be lower KPH but higher survivability regardless of aura choice. Action Bar - Laniakea's Spear \u2b25 This action bar should be used with Laniakea's Spear . It has a more offensive focus and utilizes frequent AoE usage to heal off of minions rather than using Debilitate. Quake also sees higher usage to help mitigate the spear's accuracy issues. Due to the nature of this action bar, Trimmed Masterwork Armor is recommended to help mitigate burst damage from Greg. It is not necessary, but it helps with survivability. 0% Adrenaline Bar - Laniakea's Spear \u2b25 This action bar can be used instead of the one listed above when not using Adrenaline Retention effects. This allows the user to maintain similar afk kill speeds, but foregoes some safety.

Explanation \u2b25 This method will net a higher amount of kills per compared to the melee AFK setup, but has a much higher startup cost . However, the upkeep cost is significantly cheaper when compared to the melee setup. \u2b25 While faster, sometimes you will need to move to collect your loot. As you won't be constantly close to Gregorovic, loot will often drop outside of your area-loot range. Playing on mobile mitigates the need to move due to a larger area loot radius. \u2b25 It is important to pray as this method relies on constant healing. \u2b25 Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience and is very safe to use.

This should be the most effective aura for fast kills, but is the least afk choice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not give any extra poison procs. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you may cap out your HP often and not be able to actually heal. This reduces the effectiveness of your Blood Reaver. You also need to pay more attention to your prayer between kills. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not use Reckless for afking, as it will get you killed very easily. \u2b25 A Wyvern Crossbow will be one of the most effective weapons for this setup due to its passive.

Explanation \u2b25 This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. \u2b25 It is important to pray as this method relies on constant healing. It is also important to use the Animate Dead spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage. \u2b25 Please note this setup/guide is VERY new and is subject to change in the near future. \u2b25 Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. Due to the constant damage being taken while fighting Helwyr, this is by far the safest and most reliable aura choice to afk with. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but is less safe to use and doesn't benefit the usage of a Blood Reaver familiar. It is advised to pay attention to your HP with this aura, and to be prepared to eat. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you must pay more attention to both your HP and your prayer points. This should be an effective aura for fast kills, but is the least afk choice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not give any extra poison procs. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not use Maniacal for afking, as it will get you killed very easily. \u2b25 An Inquisitor's Staff will be one of the most effective weapons for this setup due to its passive. If you do not have one, other 2-handed staffs such as Superior Zuriel's or Noxious should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower. Mandatory Requirements \u2b25 This setup should reliably allow you to afk Helwyr, with the duration between checking your status dependent on the aura you are using.

This way you can switch between Blood Burst/Blitz and Exsanguinate to see which one works best for you. \u2b25 Essence of Finality - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and Soulsplit passive. \u2b25 Reaver's Ring - Extra critical chance helps speed up kills. If not owned or a weaker staff is being used, can be substituted for other strong rings such as Asylum Surgeon's or Ring of Death. \u2b25 Book of Balance - Decent passive pocket item, provides extra poison procs and damage when activated. The damage contributed by this is actually quite massive, and should be used to ensure the most efficient kills. Reflecting Blood Essence can be used as a budget alternative.

Accessing them requires an Ascension Keystone. They each have a unique mechanic which are detailed below. As ascension members, Legiones can only be efficiently harmed with ranged, as they have extremely low affinity against magic and melee attacks. They are very good for learning how to move around and avoid mechanics while still doing damage. Each Legio kill is worth 618,133, with 297,605 of that being profit. Advanced players can get up to 250 kph, earning on average 74,401,195 gp/hr. Drops \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Signet 1/50 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Ascension grips 1/2060 (Only on task) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Corrupted signet 1/1000 (1200 threshold) Mechanics General As ascension members, Legiones can only be efficiently harmed with ranged, as they have extremely low affinity against magic and melee attacks. They take increased damage the closer the player is to them which is why it is recommended to try to stay close to the legio during the fight. Primus \u2b25 Legio Primus' unique ability is that the lower life points he has, the more damage he will deal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For every 25% life points that Primus loses, his lightning orb attacks gain 200 extra damage. Standard lighting orb attack \u2b25 Using the hit-and-run tactic as normal nullifies this ability, however it is best to eat up as being caught in the middle of a lightning attack can cause massive damage. Secundus \u2b25 Legio Secundus' unique ability is using the lightning orb attack more frequently as his life points lower. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 75% health, he will use three orb attacks, then one basic magic attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 50%, he uses a simple magic attack every four orbs, and at 25% he will exclusively attack with lightning. Secundus' rapid lighting orbs \u2b25 This is generally not a problem as using the hit-and-run tactic as normal will nullify this ability, however the lightning orbs will be more frequent so having high life points is advantageous when most of his are depleted. Tertius \u2b25 Legio Tertius' unique ability is summoning Monastery of Ascension units as his health lowers \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 3 Rorarii, 1 Gladius and 1 Capsarius when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% of his health respectively. \u2b25 The ascended spawn under Tertius, so they will can be damaged easily with Corruption Shot and Bombardment. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Gladius can be somewhat problematic, but since Legiones take increased damage the closer the player is to them, the Gladius is unlikely to move out from Corruption Shot and Bombardment will only force him to move away from the pile. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Should the Gladius be able to land a stun, immediately use Freedom and quickly move away before the lightning attack strikes. A gladius rushes towards the player Note: Any remaining minions after Tertius is killed will die. Quartus \u2b25 Legio Quartus' unique ability is teleporting the player next to him when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points and launching an additional lightning attack at/around the spot he teleported the player, on top of his regular attacks. A player is teleported \u2b25 Quartus is the only Legio where damage should be dealt carefully, as his ability can punish fast DPS players. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the player damages him too fast, then Quartus will pull the player back to the same spot when he first triggers his ability, resulting in two immediate lightning strikes dead-center which will quickly shred a player's health if Devotion is not used. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Quartus' drag is unique compared to other monsters - Freedom and Anticipation do not work, as it isn't classified as a stun attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The pull also grants him a second of invulnerability, and any channeled abilities used when he drags the player are simply put on hold for the same time, after which it is cast as normal again. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is a very dangerous mechanic and makes Quartus the most deadly of the Legiones. Quintus \u2b25 Legio Quintus' unique ability is summoning \"Lines of Ascension\" in the laboratory when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first and third lines he summons will run horizontally, while the second line runs vertically. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Accidentally running into lines and getting caught by orb attacks can easily kill a player regardless of experience. \u2b25 Stepping on one of these lines will deal incredibly heavy damage (more than the lighting strike in terms of individual damage) - however, it only hits once each time the player runs into a line, but due to the lightning orb attacks, you'll be forced to move regardless. \u2b25 It is worth noting that the player can \"force\" the lines to spawn as when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points respectively, a line will spawn wherever the player is currently. Doing this near the edges of the laboratory will effectively nullify them if they perform the hit-and-run tactic while keeping away from them completely - however, players should note that he will take less damage the further you are from him, so this is only recommended for inexperienced players. Note: the Lines of Ascension\" are extremely similar to the Queen Black Dragon's fire walls - if you stand next to a line, then run over it, you will not take any damage from the line itself. This can allow for easier maneuverability around him to deal maximum damage without having to bring him closer. Sextus \u2b25 Legio Sextus' unique ability is his lightning attacks - unlike the other Legiones, his attacks are not modified as his health decreases. \u2b25 Sextus' lightning attacks last significantly longer than his fellow Legiones, as they only start to dissipate once three strikes are on the field. In addition to the increased duration of these attacks, their AoE is increased from 4x4 to 5x5. \u2b25 This should be kept in mind while running around; doing so in an erratic way is not advised as the larger radius and prolonged duration can potentially slow down kills, though his laboratory is fairly large to avoid these attacks while dealing as much damage as possible. Sextus is fairly easy to kill, much like Primus and Secundus. Basic Strategy Simply get into MD of the boss (this is due to you doing more damage the closer you are), double bleed and walk your Fragmentation Shot . Then, do your best range threshold rotation (i.e. Snap Shot and Rapid Fire , avoiding Shadow Tendrils as Legiones have a hit cap of 7.5k and finally finish the kill with basics. Ideally, kill times should be consistently sub 20 seconds. Familiar Guidance For your familiars you have 3 main options: \u2b25 Ripper Demon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is for the 0-5% passive damage bonus only - Do not use scrolls as the familiar rarely hits due to boss affinities- \u2b25 Steel Titan \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It primarily uses a mix of Ranged and Melee attacks, so is only partially effective- \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It can take a while to agro, so is only viable for slower kills (>20s), or when manually targetting it onto the Legiones (e.g. during Snipe ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A budget option compared to Ripper Demon. \u2b25 Unicorn Stallion (for its special attack, only if struggling for HP) Manipulating Attacks A more advanced technique worth discussing is the ability to manipulate where legiones will drop their lightning balls. This involves abusing the fact that their mechanics are based on where you click, and the fact that movement can be stopped by using an ability. This is explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8A8bdTT3ic Advanced Strategy (Courtesy of #Andy - Base Tank) This method can result in around 240-250 KPH and around 200 KPH at Quartus Requirements \u2b25 Greater Ricochet \u2b25 Eldritch crossbow with Caroming 4 \u2b25 Fleeting Boots \u2b25 Nightmare Gauntlets \u2b25 Ascension Crossbows or Blightbound crossbows (For Quartus only) \u2b25 Reckless Aura Presets \u2b25 Primus/Secundus/Tertius/Sextus Preset \u2b25 Quartus/Quintus Preset \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Need food occasionally \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Replace with 2 keys for Quintus Note: Hydrix bolts are used as a switch in combination with Greater Ricochet for when you're low on adrenaline. Note also: The generic armour perks in #perks are fine, however if planning to farm for a long time, Enhanced Devoted 4 can be swapped out for the Lucky or Absorbative perks at relatively low cost as you'll be praying Soul Split anyway - You can easily combo Lucky 6 with Mobile if not already comboed with another perk.

They take increased damage the closer the player is to them which is why it is recommended to try to stay close to the legio during the fight. Primus \u2b25 Legio Primus' unique ability is that the lower life points he has, the more damage he will deal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For every 25% life points that Primus loses, his lightning orb attacks gain 200 extra damage. Standard lighting orb attack \u2b25 Using the hit-and-run tactic as normal nullifies this ability, however it is best to eat up as being caught in the middle of a lightning attack can cause massive damage. Secundus \u2b25 Legio Secundus' unique ability is using the lightning orb attack more frequently as his life points lower. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 75% health, he will use three orb attacks, then one basic magic attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 50%, he uses a simple magic attack every four orbs, and at 25% he will exclusively attack with lightning. Secundus' rapid lighting orbs \u2b25 This is generally not a problem as using the hit-and-run tactic as normal will nullify this ability, however the lightning orbs will be more frequent so having high life points is advantageous when most of his are depleted. Tertius \u2b25 Legio Tertius' unique ability is summoning Monastery of Ascension units as his health lowers \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 3 Rorarii, 1 Gladius and 1 Capsarius when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% of his health respectively. \u2b25 The ascended spawn under Tertius, so they will can be damaged easily with Corruption Shot and Bombardment. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Gladius can be somewhat problematic, but since Legiones take increased damage the closer the player is to them, the Gladius is unlikely to move out from Corruption Shot and Bombardment will only force him to move away from the pile. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Should the Gladius be able to land a stun, immediately use Freedom and quickly move away before the lightning attack strikes. A gladius rushes towards the player Note: Any remaining minions after Tertius is killed will die. Quartus \u2b25 Legio Quartus' unique ability is teleporting the player next to him when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points and launching an additional lightning attack at/around the spot he teleported the player, on top of his regular attacks. A player is teleported \u2b25 Quartus is the only Legio where damage should be dealt carefully, as his ability can punish fast DPS players. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the player damages him too fast, then Quartus will pull the player back to the same spot when he first triggers his ability, resulting in two immediate lightning strikes dead-center which will quickly shred a player's health if Devotion is not used. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Quartus' drag is unique compared to other monsters - Freedom and Anticipation do not work, as it isn't classified as a stun attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The pull also grants him a second of invulnerability, and any channeled abilities used when he drags the player are simply put on hold for the same time, after which it is cast as normal again. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is a very dangerous mechanic and makes Quartus the most deadly of the Legiones. Quintus \u2b25 Legio Quintus' unique ability is summoning \"Lines of Ascension\" in the laboratory when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first and third lines he summons will run horizontally, while the second line runs vertically. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Accidentally running into lines and getting caught by orb attacks can easily kill a player regardless of experience. \u2b25 Stepping on one of these lines will deal incredibly heavy damage (more than the lighting strike in terms of individual damage) - however, it only hits once each time the player runs into a line, but due to the lightning orb attacks, you'll be forced to move regardless. \u2b25 It is worth noting that the player can \"force\" the lines to spawn as when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points respectively, a line will spawn wherever the player is currently. Doing this near the edges of the laboratory will effectively nullify them if they perform the hit-and-run tactic while keeping away from them completely - however, players should note that he will take less damage the further you are from him, so this is only recommended for inexperienced players. Note: the Lines of Ascension\" are extremely similar to the Queen Black Dragon's fire walls - if you stand next to a line, then run over it, you will not take any damage from the line itself. This can allow for easier maneuverability around him to deal maximum damage without having to bring him closer. Sextus \u2b25 Legio Sextus' unique ability is his lightning attacks - unlike the other Legiones, his attacks are not modified as his health decreases. \u2b25 Sextus' lightning attacks last significantly longer than his fellow Legiones, as they only start to dissipate once three strikes are on the field. In addition to the increased duration of these attacks, their AoE is increased from 4x4 to 5x5. \u2b25 This should be kept in mind while running around; doing so in an erratic way is not advised as the larger radius and prolonged duration can potentially slow down kills, though his laboratory is fairly large to avoid these attacks while dealing as much damage as possible. Sextus is fairly easy to kill, much like Primus and Secundus.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/mid-tier-pvm/legiones/#basic-strategy","text":"Simply get into MD of the boss (this is due to you doing more damage the closer you are), double bleed and walk your Fragmentation Shot .

Overview of the Fight Phase 1: \u2b25 QBD attacks with or auto attacks (when the player is standing 2 tiles north from the platform artefact) and the occasional fire wall. \u2b25 Fire Wall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The chatbox will say \"The Queen Black Dragon takes a huge breath.\" prior to her fire wall special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the fire wall hits your character, your character will take 750 typeless damage for each tick (generally 2 ticks) it hits you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 By walking through it, you only take 1 tick of damage and because of this, it is recommended to walk through the firewall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, with each firewall, there is a gap where you can stand and not take any damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The gap will either be on the 5th square, 9th square (one left of the center artefact) or the 15th square. \u2b25 Phase 1 can be ended by depleting her life pool of 25k HP and activating the middle artefact. The QBD will spit out grotworms until you activate the artefact. Phase 2: \u2b25 QBD will do her previous mechanics however with each Phase her fire wall gets stronger. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In Phase 1, the firewall will have 1 wall you have to pass through. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In Phase 2, it will have 2 walls. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In Phase 3, there will be 3 walls, and so on. \u2b25 Tortured Souls \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There will be an onscreen message saying \"The Queen Black Dragon summons one of her Captured Souls.\" \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This mechanic causes 1 Tortured Soul to appear and release a cloud that deals 900 damage to the player unless it hits a Tortured Soul or grotworm first. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- One way to deal with this mechanic is to learn how to time the cloud correctly and walk over the Tortured Soul, causing it to deal 900 damage to the Soul instead of you. Phase 3: \u2b25 From now on QBD will breathe 4 fire walls for the reminder of the fight. \u2b25 She will now summon 2 Tortured Souls instead of 1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1 Soul will spawn on each side of the player, so in order to avoid getting damaged, move over one when the text box appears above their head. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In addition to the 2 Tortured Souls, any Souls in the arena can be used to heal the QBD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The chatbox will say \"The Queen Black Dragon starts to siphon the energy of her mages.\" and will heal her 200 each tick from each Tortured Soul. \u2b25 Crystal Form/Hardened Carapace \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Queen Black Dragon takes on the consistency of crystal; she is more resistant to magic, but weaker to physical damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This means she will take 25% less damage and 25% more and damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Queen Black Dragon hardens her carapace; she is more resistant to physical damage, but more vulnerable to magic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This means she will take 25% less damage from and but 25% more damage. Phase 4: \u2b25 She will now summon 4 Tortured Souls (one on each diagonal from the character). This Phase only has 2 new mechanics. \u2b25 Time Stop \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A Soul will appear in one of the far corners of the arena saying 3 of the following: \"Time is short!\", \"She is pouring her energy into me...hurry!\" and \"The spell is nearly complete!\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You must kill the Tortured Soul or QBD before the Tortured Soul says all three. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the Tortured Soul gets to the final dialogue, a few seconds later you will be frozen for a few seconds, unable to move, eat, or do anything until the special is over. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This can be very deadly if paired with a Tortured Soul Special or the QBD's final special attack, the Extreme Dragon Breath. \u2b25 Extreme Dragon Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Does high hitting damage if not avoided correctly and is prompted when the chat box says, \"The Queen Black Dragon gathers her strength to breathe extremely hot flames.\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to stand on the far right side of the arena in order to avoid as much of the attack as possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you stand in the center of the arena, you will take over twice the amount of damage as the side. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also is the special attack needed to brand the Royal Crossbow.

Phase 2: \u2b25 QBD will do her previous mechanics however with each Phase her fire wall gets stronger. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In Phase 1, the firewall will have 1 wall you have to pass through. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In Phase 2, it will have 2 walls. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In Phase 3, there will be 3 walls, and so on. \u2b25 Tortured Souls \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There will be an onscreen message saying \"The Queen Black Dragon summons one of her Captured Souls.\" \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This mechanic causes 1 Tortured Soul to appear and release a cloud that deals 900 damage to the player unless it hits a Tortured Soul or grotworm first. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- One way to deal with this mechanic is to learn how to time the cloud correctly and walk over the Tortured Soul, causing it to deal 900 damage to the Soul instead of you. Phase 3: \u2b25 From now on QBD will breathe 4 fire walls for the reminder of the fight. \u2b25 She will now summon 2 Tortured Souls instead of 1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1 Soul will spawn on each side of the player, so in order to avoid getting damaged, move over one when the text box appears above their head. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In addition to the 2 Tortured Souls, any Souls in the arena can be used to heal the QBD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The chatbox will say \"The Queen Black Dragon starts to siphon the energy of her mages.\" and will heal her 200 each tick from each Tortured Soul. \u2b25 Crystal Form/Hardened Carapace \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Queen Black Dragon takes on the consistency of crystal; she is more resistant to magic, but weaker to physical damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This means she will take 25% less damage and 25% more and damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Queen Black Dragon hardens her carapace; she is more resistant to physical damage, but more vulnerable to magic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This means she will take 25% less damage from and but 25% more damage. Phase 4: \u2b25 She will now summon 4 Tortured Souls (one on each diagonal from the character). This Phase only has 2 new mechanics. \u2b25 Time Stop \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A Soul will appear in one of the far corners of the arena saying 3 of the following: \"Time is short!\", \"She is pouring her energy into me...hurry!\" and \"The spell is nearly complete!\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You must kill the Tortured Soul or QBD before the Tortured Soul says all three. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the Tortured Soul gets to the final dialogue, a few seconds later you will be frozen for a few seconds, unable to move, eat, or do anything until the special is over. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This can be very deadly if paired with a Tortured Soul Special or the QBD's final special attack, the Extreme Dragon Breath. \u2b25 Extreme Dragon Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Does high hitting damage if not avoided correctly and is prompted when the chat box says, \"The Queen Black Dragon gathers her strength to breathe extremely hot flames.\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It is recommended to stand on the far right side of the arena in order to avoid as much of the attack as possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you stand in the center of the arena, you will take over twice the amount of damage as the side. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also is the special attack needed to brand the Royal Crossbow.","title":"Overview of the Fight"},{"location":"pvme-guides/mid-tier-pvm/queen-black-dragon/#example-kill","text":"https://youtu.be/aE0YMUlK4Jk","title":"Example Kill"},{"location":"pvme-guides/mid-tier-pvm/rex-matriarchs/","text":"Rex matriarchs Rex Matriarchs (Courtesy of #Roarroar) Introduction The rex matriarchs are a trio of dinosaur bosses found on anachronia.

When the timer expires a 3x3 torrent will appear at the player's tile. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The torrent applies the Overcharged buff. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It deals increasing hard typeless damage capping out at 3600 every 2 ticks. \u2b25 Overcharged - For 30 seconds an additional magic damage hit is caused by players' abilities and attacks (excluding poison) at 5% of their original damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The cooldown of Surge is reduced to 1 tick. Getting hit by the torrent refreshes the Overcharged buff. \u2b25 Ranged Attack - Pthentraken spins, sending a rock flying towards the player which deals up to 3500 ranged damage. General Strategy Orikalka \u2b25 Orikalka should be killed using 2-3 Entangles (to avoid frostbite) and fire spells . \u2b25 4TAA is recommended to increase DPS and weave in (and Vulnerability if not using ). \u2b25 Start the kill with a Guthix Staff special attack if having low accuracy. \u2b25 Prioritise bleeds / until first lands. Immediately build to Sunshine . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use a wand and a defender with Planted Feet to and . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A defender is recommended for the accuracy boost it provides. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Watching for a magic xp drop can assist in confirming has landed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Wrack should be used almost whenever it is off cooldown to build when Orikalka is stunned or rooted. \u2b25 Once Orikalka moves, use again and move to the other side of your to avoid attacks. \u2b25 If Orikalka is not dead when the second ends, kite her with stuns like Deep Impact and Asphyxiate or do a 3rd depending on hp. \u2b25 If you get Frostbite, Deflect Melee and do not kill Orikalka. Wait until fissures spawn, and then run or Bladed Dive to one. Dealing with Frostbite https://youtu.be/zx-JstVzl0k Pthentraken \u2b25 Prayer flicking every auto attack is strongly recommended as she hits the hardest of the three, especially the ranged attack. \u2b25 If not using Insulated Boots , move to avoid Converging Lighting to edge tiles of Death's Swiftness . Stay here to place the Overcharge Torrent and then return to the middle. \u2b25 When the next Converging Lighting begins, run to the other side of . \u2b25 If using , simply turn on Deflect Mage during Converging Lighting to take almost no damage. Flick to Deflect Missiles after the lighting passes for the ranged attack. \u2b25 Staying closer to this boss will make her attacks land sooner. Rathis \u2b25 Avoiding first Poison Bombardment is recommended as you are likely under Berserk , and can get bursted if both projectiles land on you. \u2b25 Stand on a Poison Pit to reduce the overheal if not confident in killing Rathis before poison absorption. \u2b25 Antipoison potion effects and the Venomblood perk both reduce poison damage, but Irit Incense Sticks do not. Introduction to Hybrid Strategies In general, use weapons of at least T90 accuracy that allow you to exploit the weaknesses of the Matriarchs. If not owning weapons to hit on their respective weakness(e.g. Do not own a T90+ bow) or weapons are low tier, ensure that you\u2019re on task/zerker aura/highest accuracy aura for that style. Note: Most of the presets listed focus on high level hybriding which can easily yield more than 70 kph. Due to the number of combinations available, intermediate presets are not provided. Alternatives to Listed Strategies \u2b25 If Blessed Flask is not owned, presets should be made for 30 minute combat instead of camping the entire instance. \u2b25 4 Restore Flasks are recommended in such a preset. \u2b25 Reaver and Kwuarm Incense Sticks can be included in a bonfire preset instead to make more inventory space. \u2b25 Perked hybrid armour such as Sliske\u2019s Anima body and legs can be taken instead, although this will reduce kph. Mage/Ranged Hybrid Two Versions are provided, one with physical ECB and the other with Hexhunter Bow and EoF ECB , of which the latter is better by a little bit.

Otherwise, should be used on the second under Sun to avoid splashes. \u2b25 If you end Orikalka below 100% adrenaline, target Rathis from a distance and use basics to gain adrenaline. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Getting adren - https://youtu.be/PfhJG00n61s Example Kills https://youtu.be/9LjGF5O4RQQ Melee/Ranged Hybrid This method of hybridding yields the highest kph, but is also the hardest to pull off due to the high amount of damage taken and the need to avoid Orikalka.

Otherwise, use a Zaros Godsword Special Attack to kill Rathis instead of Berserk , finishing off with bleeds . \u2b25 Use Ingenuity to bleed an assault with Terrasaur maul if is up. Otherwise, bleed with your main stab weapons. \u2b25 Use alternate between using an adrenaline potion and limitless for melee kills.

Note: While waiting for Pthentraken's death animation, build adrenaline on Orikalka. \u2b25 At war's retreat, to use Altar of War, to bank and to Adrenaline Crystals. Example Kill ( + ) https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1033769908 Afk Strategies Some afk strategies are viable for Rathis and Orikalka. However, they do not give as much kph as active killing. Rathis Camp Soul Split . If using lower tiered armor or otherwise notice that you constantly require food, Vampirism aura should be taken along with 10 Super Restore flasks and Holy Wrench to upkeep prayer. This setup yields about 40-42 kph. \u2b25 Revo Bar \u2b25 Preset \u2b25 Relics \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Persistent Rage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Fury of the Small \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Berserker's Fury Orikalka Use Legacy with Blood Barrage (Blood Blitz if using inquisitor's staff ) as Frostbite does not affect the speed of auto attacks. Use Deflect Melee to avoid getting bursted by unlucky fissure spawns. Even through prayer and Death Ward, fissures can still kill if unlucky. Thus, it is not completely recommended to afk using this preset. Use the highest tier of restoration portent available to you. Absorbative and Enhanced Devoted perks help survive unlucky fissures.

Advanced players can get up to 70 kph, earning on average 19,604,561 gp/hr. Presets Advanced Melee Preset \u2b25 A halberd range weapon such as a Noxious Scythe or Dragonrider Lance should be used because AoE melee abilities will hit both furies effectively doing double damage. \u2b25 If you're struggling with food conservation and Soul Split is not enough to heal you, you may also use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism to help sustain yourself for the full hour. Otherwise, an unactivated god book can remain in your pocket slot. \u2b25 An elite Enhanced Excalibur and Ancient Elven Ritual shard are used to supplement your HP and prayer upkeep. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Enhanced Luck Potion - Gives tier 3 luck, can be removed if swapping to LotD \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Adrenaline Urn - Prevents adren loss after dropping combat, stores up to 1000% adrenaline \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Ancient Elven Ritual Shard - Restores prayer overtime, 5 minute cooldown \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for and ) Note: Currently, Deathtouch Bracelet is used as Cinderbane Gloves are bugged at Twin Furies. Mechanics Jumps Avaryss jumps towards the northern wall and charges down to the southern wall. She will repeat this attack a total of 4 times and will always travel in the cardinal directions (north to south, west to east, etc.). You may simply move out of the way after Avaryss jumps to a new wall. Any single link of this mechanic can be dealt with by using Resonance for a free heal, but is not required to deal with the mechanic at all. Ceiling Collapse Nymora will jump to a random square in the arena and cause a ceiling collapse. You have to stand in the 3x3 area around her to negate the damage from the collapse. Note: Currently Nymora is bugged and will dissapear shortly after taking flight. Pay attention to where she goes and react appropiately. Channeled Bomb The twins will jump to the center of the arena and channel a bomb attack. During this special, you will take ticks of typeless damage which can easily be negated with Soul Split If the channel finishes and the kill is not over, a bomb will detonate dealing 4,500 damage. This bomb can be avoided by Surging to the edges of the arena or blocking it with defensives. During this phase, the twins take 2x damage and stand close enough that Cleave , Hurricane , and Quake will hit both of them. AFK Strategy (~30-38 kph) (Courtesy of #FriggityFrank & #Martin) Gp/hr Total 8,401,955 Note: Assumes Max Reputation and 30 kph. Explanation \u2b25 This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that. \u2b25 It is important to pray as this method relies on constant healing. It is also important to use the Animate Dead spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage. \u2b25 NOTE: Utilizing even one source of extra healing mitigates a LOT of the danger presented by this method so long as Trimmed Masterwork Armour is being used. Do keep in mind though that the safest option by far is to use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . \u2b25 Please note this setup/guide is VERY new and is subject to change in the near future. \u2b25 Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you must pay more attention to both your HP and your prayer points. This should be an effective aura for fast kills, but is technically the least afk choice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but is less safe to use. It is advised to pay attention to your HP with this aura, and to be prepared to eat in case your HP drops too low. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing. This can mitigate the need for a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism and allows other pocket slot items to be used safely, such as a Zamorak God Book. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not offer anything else. It is a viable option as a secondary aura. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not use Berserker for afking, as it will get you killed very easily. \u2b25 A Masterwork Spear of Annihilation will be the most effective weapon for this setup due to its passive effect and accuracy. If you do not have one, other 2-handed melee weapons such as Superior Vesta's Spear or Noxious Scythe should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower.

KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that. \u2b25 It is important to pray as this method relies on constant healing.

While Magic is good for increased mobility and access to Vulnerability . It is possible to Soul Split the entire encounter with decent DPS. Otherwise, it's recommended to prayer flick/Resonance the ranged hits. As long as minimum time is spent within the dragonfire lines, survivability should not be a major issue. Hurricane Fairly average damage melee attack in the area within 2 squares of Vindicta. If the boss cannot reach you with this attack, she will instead launch a ranged hit that deals a moderate amount of damage. In general it can be completely ignored but learners may find it useful to Resonance this hit to save food. Dragonfire Vindicta will raise her arms to signal Gorvek to fly overhead and drop a dragonfire smoke line from a random direction on top of the player. This will deal continuous damage as long as it is stood in and should be moved out of immediately. This is a good opportunity to walk Combust , Fragmentation Shot , or Slaughter . Gorvek (Phase 2) Once Vindicta reaches 100k hp she will mount Gorvek, signalling the start of phase 2. The boss' hitbox will increase at this point which can potentially walk the player into nearby dragonfire. From here on, the boss will follow a very simple autoattack rotation: Ranged attack: Vindicta deals a moderate amount of ranged damage to a random target. Dragonfire Wall: Vindicta commands Gorvek to engulf a straight line in flames. Exactly the same as the dragonfire from Phase 1 This is identical to the lines placed during phase 1 and can be dealt with the same way.## Advanced Melee Rotations (~65 kph, Courtesy of #Badier) Note: These rotations assume you are using the Fury of the small relic and instance hopping Kill 1: (100% adrenaline required) \u2192 (tc) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 (2-hit) \u2192 \u2192 (fastest) \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Improvise (Finish kill on 82%+ adrenaline, if you triple Imp Proc or Asr/Relentless 3hit flurry under sigil and dont 5taa later) Kill 2: (82% adrenaline required) (tc) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 Auto + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) OR (5taa) \u2192 \u2192 Basics until kill ends.

AFK Strategy (~30-38 kph) (Courtesy of #FriggityFrank & #Vengeance) Gp/hr Total 9,935,718 Note: Assumes Max Reputation and 30 kph. Explanation \u2b25 This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that. \u2b25 It is important to pray as this method relies on constant mitigating Vindicta & Gorvek's near-constant fire damage. It is also important to use the Animate Dead spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage. \u2b25 Please note this setup/guide is VERY new and is subject to change in the near future. \u2b25 Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing.

Explanation \u2b25 This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that. \u2b25 It is important to pray as this method relies on constant mitigating Vindicta & Gorvek's near-constant fire damage. It is also important to use the Animate Dead spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage. \u2b25 Please note this setup/guide is VERY new and is subject to change in the near future. \u2b25 Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing. Due to the constant damage being taken while fighting Vindicta & Gorvek, this is by far the safest and most reliable aura choice to afk with. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but is less safe to use. It is advised to pay attention to your HP with this aura, and to be prepared to eat. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you must pay more attention to both your HP and your prayer points. This should be an effective aura for fast kills, but is the least afk choice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not provide anything else. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not use Berserker for afking, as it will get you killed very easily. \u2b25 A Masterwork Spear of Annihilation will be the most effective weapon for this setup due to its passive effect and accuracy.

This will stop your movement and prevent you from walking and cancelling your Onslaught. Slow Hitting Abilities (Courtesy of #Prism and #Martin) In RS, there are some abilities whose damage will go through one tick after they are activated, and some abilities whose damage will be delayed. The latter are known as slow abilities, and are worth being aware of. Abilities / Abilities and DW Additionally, for auto attacks, all surge spells and all blitz spells will hit a tick slow. with DW (stalled) hits instantly from any distance Additionally, most abilities hit slower when cast from a distance.

If your target is facing any other direction, flanking works from a 90-(90-the amount of degrees your target is from facing where you're standing)\u00b0 angle. In the below picture, black is your target, red is the direction your target is facing, and green is where flanking works. Freedom Autos (Courtesy of #Wh) Freedom is unique in the respect that it can be used to force an offhand auto as well as a 2h auto within 3t. This has many uses like freedom vuln (using vuln instead of the offhand auto loses less damage than if you were to do it in place of a 2h auto), as well as accelerated adren gain because you also get adren from 2 autos. Mage: It's usually easier to time, and also often beneficial to do it immediately after a 2h abil, as this means the 2h auto comes at the same time as your next ability. You do the following: Tick 0: Activate abil with staff equipped Tick 0-3: Equip dual wield Tick 3: Click auto \u2192 freedom (you don't have to click the keybind for this auto if you just want a regular auto). Tick 4-6: Switch to staff Tick 6: Click auto \u2192 abil You can see a clip of this here: https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk For other styles you'll need to do it after a dual wield ability (or delay your ability afterwards but this isn't worthwhile): Tick 0: Activate abil with dual wield equipped Tick 3: Activate freedom Tick 4: Equip 2h Tick 6: Activate abil You can see a clip of this here: https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8 It's worth noting that if you're maging and freedom after a dual wield ability, to avoid losing autos you have to do a dual wield ability immediately after as well. Consider: any abil \u2192 dw abil \u2192 freedom (oh + 2h auto) \u2192 dw abil \u2192 auto + staff abil staff abil \u2192 freedom (oh + 2h auto) \u2192 any abil \u2192 dw abil \u2192 auto + staff abil If you just did a staff ability afterwards: staff abil \u2192 dw abil \u2192 freedom (oh + 2h auto) \u2192 any abil \u2192 dw abil you'd clearly lose an auto. You can also use freedom to cancel a channelled ability. In order to do this you have to click the target on the same tick you use freedom, or you won't get the offhand auto off. You also have to delay your subsequent ability by 1 tick in order to get your 2h auto off. Forcing an Auto with Defensives When using a defensive, an auto attack will be fired. When using , this auto attack can be changed from a normal auto into a utility spell, such as or . This is done by pressing the keybind for or , followed by the keybind for , , , or . Switching Weapons during Detonate (Courtesy of #Keny) During the detonate channel, it is possible to switch weapons without Detonate being released. It is also possible to channel shield dome inside detonate, provided detonate is pressed first. This will cost the auto on detonate release, but is situationally useful at Vorago. It is also worth noting that it's possible to Spellbook Swap in deto, allowing for a vuln release. https://youtu.be/OxXEWwHODwQ Shield Dome Detonate In certain cases, most notably at Vorago, it is beneficial to be in shield dome while channelling detonate. This is done by channelling detonate, then channelling shield dome. This will result in a lost auto, but can be prevented by sipping a super restore or an overload salve to cancel the shield dome. https://youtu.be/wxoyeMobO_o Dragon Battleaxe Spec The Dragon battleaxe has a unique spec that is often used in speed kills due to providing a noticeable damage increase at the cost of a large amount of adrenaline, therefore is quite useful when prepared before hand or in other niche situations. The Spec works as following, by draining 10% (rounded down) of your attack, range, magic, and defence levels and a multiplicative 10% reduction in your hit chance, you will be given a strength level boost of 10 + 1 level for every 4 drained from your other stats, as well as a hidden damage boost of 1.2x your damage, this also stacks with Zaros godsword spec going from a 1.25x to 1.5x boost, or 1.1x when under the effect of berserk, making berserk a 2.2x damage boost. This boost overall lasts 1 minute. It\u2019s most common uses are setup before hand for a speed/record kills where you will Dragon battleaxe in conjunction with natural instinct to make the most of the boost before going into the kill, or for an Araxxor p3 skip and certain 1 cycle core Solak rotations. Bladed Dive Bladed Dive Angle After using Bladed Dive it will leave your character facing a consistent direction. It's important to be comfortable with this so you can Bladed Dive \u2192 Surge and move in a predictable manner. See this graphic for more information (Courtesy of @76883062381621248 ): Bladed Dive AoE The way in which Bladed Dive's AoE works is that when you BD onto a target it will move you to a position, and this position becomes the center of the AoE as shown in the following graphic: Back-to-Back Special Attacks (Courtesy of #sfox) How It Works Doing b2b (or more) specs seems to follow a pattern of [X tick loss, Y tick loss] of every b2b [odd, even] spec, as shown in the following table: Ability before spec spamming: Fast/Fastest Ability \u2192 no tick loss, no tick loss Average Ability \u2192 no tick loss, 1 tick loss Slowest Ability \u2192 no tick loss, 7 tick loss Auto before spec spamming: Fastest Auto \u2192 no tick loss, 1 tick loss Fast Auto \u2192 no tick loss, 2 tick loss Average Auto \u2192 no tick loss, 3 tick loss Slowest Auto \u2192 no tick loss, 9 tick loss Note: these tests were done using non-channeled abilities and special attacks, interactions with channeled abilities and special attacks still need to be documented.

Cooldown Brief Introduction \u2b25 Generally speaking casting an ability will reset the auto's cooldown, and for channels each casted hit resets it. Cooldowns Work as Follows \u2b25 \u200e \u200eEvery weapon has a weapon speed tied to it. This is used to determine the auto's cooldown based on the auto or ability fired: Speed (cooldown in ticks/seconds) Slowest (12t/7.2s) Average (6t/3.6s) Fast (5t/3.0s) Fastest (4t/2.4s) Note: There are exceptions to if, when, and how abilities incur the cooldown, these will be discussed later Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., \"Average Ability\") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it How Cooldowns Work with Melee and Magic \u2b25 For Melee and Magic it is best to think of the auto cooldown system as one where the cooldowns set overlap, and only when all these overlapping cooldowns end can you cast an auto. Let us look at a couple scenarios and talk about why they would or would not work: Scenario 1 (Will Not Work): Average Auto + Fastest Ability \u2192 (4t) Auto + Ability \u2b25 This will not work, why? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Avg. Auto applies a 6t cooldown and the Fastest Ability applies a 4t cooldown, these overlap \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the GCD ends there will still be 3t of cooldown left from the Avg. Auto and 1t from the Fastest Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Waiting 1t more means the Auto is still on a 2t cooldown from the Avg. Auto, though the cooldown applied by the Fastest Ability has ended \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Hence, you cannot Auto 4t after the Fastest Ability despite it applying a 4t cooldown, since there is still 2t of cooldown remaining from the Avg Auto Scenario 2 (Will Work): Average Auto + Average Ability \u2192 Fastest Ability \u2192 (4t) Auto + Ability \u2b25 This will work, why? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Avg. Auto and Ability will both apply an overlapping 6t auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Fastest Ability after will apply a 4t cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- At this point the cooldowns from the Average Auto and Ability from before are at 3t remaining \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 By the time the GCD after this Fastest Ability ends, the cooldown set by the initial Average Auto and Ability end \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, 1t of cooldown remains from the Fastest ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, you must wait 1t more, and so 4t the Auto after, in order to actually get it as it will be off cooldown only then How Cooldowns Work with Ranged Work \u2b25 It is worth reiterating that this system of overlapping cooldowns only applies to Melee and Magic \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ranged simply just uses the cooldown set by the last thing cast, auto or ability, due to a bug that was never patched with it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This means in Scenario 1 with Ranged you would be able to 4t the auto rather than waiting the full 6t. How Channeled Abilities Interact with the auto Cooldown \u2b25 You can think of each hit of a channeled ability being \"cast\" where each cast incurs the auto cooldown as expected Exceptions \u2b25 \u200e \u200eAs mentioned, there are exceptions when it comes to abilities that affect the cooldown. Abilities that incur the cooldown on cast are typically referred to as \"damaging abilities\", there are also \"non-damaging abilities\" which exist that do not, they are as follows: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Note: ZGS Spec is actually a damaging ability, and hence it would try to drag you in like one; however, it does not actually affect the auto cooldown, hence why it is listed here Note: Unlike normal non-damaging abilities, Freedom will always give you an off-hand auto on cast with it \u2b25 \u200e \u200eMoreover, there are other abilities that affect or interact with the cooldown in unexpected ways, they are as follows: , , , (+ ), In-depth Look at these Unexpected Abilities Tsunami and Omnipower \u2b25 Tsunami and Omnipower works as follows: T0: Average/Fastest Nami/Omni cast T5: Fastest cast Nami/Omni Auto cast T6: Average cast Nami/Omni Auto cast \u2b25 Essentially, if you cast / with an Average speed weapon (Staff), the auto cooldown will be affected as expected \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, if you cast it with a Fastest speed weapon (Wand), the auto cooldown will be delayed a tick further than normal Shadow Tendrils \u2b25 Shadow Tendrils is technically a damaging ability, but unlike normal damaging abilities it incurs the auto cooldown later, either 2t (1.2s) after you activate it, this is when it is cast, or 3t (1.8s) after activation, which is when it hits \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you do a fastest , it will reset the auto cooldown on t3, otherwise t2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you do your weapon swap input <2t after (where is activated on t0) it will use the new weapon speed's auto cooldown, otherwise it will use the weapon you casted with's auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because of this, like a non-damaging ability you can get an auto cast during the GCD \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Unlike non-damaging abilities, to get this lossless auto the ability before must be cast with a fastest weapon and also non-channeled \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, unlike normal non-damaging abilities, if you offed (this will be explained later) you will have to spam click after casting to get the auto. Though, if you click before you only need to click once to get back on to get the auto \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u2192 ECB Special \u2b25 ECB special , unlike normal non-damaging abilities, actually extends the auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It adds 2 ticks to the cooldown \u2b25 Therefore, to get an auto with your will be done as follows: T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability t3: ECB Spec t6: Auto cast t7: Ability \u2b25 Video Demonstration (Courtesy of #---) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: auto \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (4t/2.4s) \u2b25 That being said, to most efficiently make use of uptime when you want to get the auto, ideally you delay casting your by 1t as follows: T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability T4: ECB Spec T6: Auto cast T7: Ability \u2b25 Further, with ECB EoF spec , you can get an offhand auto on cast, similar to Freedom \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Though there seems to be some conditions related to this, for instance: Fastest non-channeled Ability \u2192 ECB spec does not work Fastest non-channeled Ability + click to off \u2192 ECB spec does work Fastest non-channeled Ability \u2192 Defensive \u2192 ECB spec also works (even if you do not click off) \u2b25 Video Demonstration of an example (Courtesy of #Pernix) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: Auto \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Detonate \u2b25 Detonate is technically a damaging ability, but unlike normal damaging abilities it incurs the auto cooldown when you release it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because of this, you can release with an auto as follows: Average Auto + Ability \u2192 Detonate (3t+/1.8s+) \u2192 Average Auto + Detonate + Ability Note: The order you execute the release is important to get the Auto, , and the Ability \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u2192 (3t/1.8s) \u2192 Adrenaline The adrenaline per auto works as follows: Note: this also displays the adrenaline with various ranks of Invigorate Note: Unlike abilities, autos do not give adrenaline when you splash Damage Rough Idea \u2b25 There are three factors to auto damage: weapon tier, weapon type, and weapon speed \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Slower things hit harder, similarly 2H weapons hit harder than mainhand weapons and mainhand weapons harder than offhand, hence why you preferably will auto with the slowest 2H weapon you have \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is not to say you should default to the slowest weapon of course, because weapon tier is also a factor, but if the tiers are close then odds are the slower weapon will hit harder assuming all other things are equal. Offing What it is \u2b25 It is important to mention that autos can be forced to not automatically try and fire when their cooldown ends by \"offing\", this is done as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking under yourself \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you are on Revolution this will not work, you instead have to click to the sides of you \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking a spell you cannot cast (e.g., trying to cast Disruption Shield when on the Ancient Spellbook) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking something from your inventory Clicking vs Auto Bind The Differences \u2b25 It is also important to clarify key differences between clicking your target to auto and using an auto bind to get back on after offing to auto: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You cannot hit your auto bind to try and recast your auto mid-GCD, you would need to atleast 3 tick it (i.e., wait for GCD to end) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you use your auto bind to recast your auto, you can alter what the auto will be when you cast it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is mostly applicable to Magic \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can click to recast your auto mid-GCD \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you click to recast your auto, your next ability must be at least 1t after otherwise you will override it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- if you click to recast your auto ideally you do it mid-GCD so that you do not waste ticks \u2b25 One important benefit of an auto bind though is the ability to cast an auto and ability on the same tick \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Normally, an auto is executed after an ability in a tick, and so normally an ability will override it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is why you cannot 4TAA with Melee and Ranged autos, and instead need to cast the ability on the 5th tick as opposed to the 4th tick with the auto Application: Defensive Autos Note: While this section is colloquialy referred to as \"Defensive Autos\", it is more technical to say they are non-damaging abilities, and so includes things like Sunshine and Metamorphosis . Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., \"Average Ability\") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it Why Defensive Autos Exist \u2b25 As mentioned non-damaging abilities (and with exception damaging abilities) will not put your auto on cooldown on cast \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This has several implications, the first applies to all styles, the second is magic specific Implications \u2b25 Firstly, this means if you cast a fast/fastest ability into a defensive ability, your auto will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage or Entagle ) then the defensive on the same tick \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For Melee/Ranged this will just be your default auto, though you can alter it to a spell like still \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following table will break down the ticks of this: T0: Fast/Fastest Ability T3: Defensive T4/5: Auto is cast T6: Ability \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Magic: \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Melee: \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Range: \u2192 \u2192 \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H auto, as the cooldown for any auto ends on t4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- So, you would simply swap to a 2H weapon between the Fast/Fastest Ability cast to before the Auto would be cast \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A further consideration is if that Ability on t6 is a non-channeled fastest ability, you can 4t an ability afterwards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This also requires a t4 auto to work assuming an Average auto after the t0 ability, therefore it only works when you do a Fastest ability into the Defensive \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is Magic specific, though can apply for Debuff spells cast by other styles \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This can be seen in the following video by #Glaucon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw \u2b25 Secondly, as mentioned, Magic, due to it having auto binds, can make sure an auto + ability is cast on the same tick \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows Magic to do an avg. ability into a defensive auto as a result \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following table will break down the ticks of this: T0: Average Ability T3: Defensive T6: Auto + Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Melee and Ranged this would result in: T0: Average Speed Ability T3: Defensive T6: Auto auto-casts T7: Ability \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Magic: \u2192 \u2192 (3t) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Melee: \u2192 \u2192 (3t) (does not net an auto) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Melee: \u2192 \u2192 (4t) (does net an auto) \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is important as it is highly beneficial to use when staff camping with Magic, as it will aid in preventing you from using bad abilities like Tuska's Wrath and Sacrifice due to the lack of abilities at your disposal Freedom \u2b25 It is important to note that Freedom works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2H auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by doing auto \u2192 on the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you wanted to change what the 2H auto is, you would have to 3 tick it. \u2b25 If you wanted to change what the off-hand auto is for Melee or Range (i.e., to replace the auto for some specific spell), to cast the spell you are required to equip an off-hand magic weapon such as an Ancient Lantern . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is important to note that you must have an off-hand auto cast set \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Because of this it is recommended to use Polypore Strike as it can be accessed by all books, which allows you to Spellbook Swap between books without issue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is recommended that you set the off-hand auto cast before the start of your hour \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, you must have the mage off-hand weapon equipped to do so or it will not set it. Delaying Defensive Auto \u2b25 Further, as mentioned, you can delay autos by offing, and so you can make use of this if you need to delay a defensive auto for whatever reason \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what both the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting after a faster-than-Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H auto if you 3t it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following examples will be done with , however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the the auto should be cast \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For specifically we will \"off\" to delay the auto directly after the OH auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH auto Note: If you off before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto. \u2b25 Thus, for we can do as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Instead of the normal T0: Fast/Fastest Speed Ability T3: DW Freedom + OH Auto Cast T4/5: 2H Auto cast T6: Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We can instead do: T0: Fast/Fastest Wield Ability T3: DW Freedom + OH Auto cast T4/5: \"Off\" T6: 2H Auto + Ability Note: For both of these sample videos, Air Surge is the autocast spell and Fire Surge is the manually selected auto. The Defensive auto is manually changed to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration \u2b25 What are the differences between these two scenarios? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2H auto is cast and thus hits at different times \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We can alter the 2H auto in the second scenario, whereas in the first it will be whatever your autocast spell is \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- We can alter the OH auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto \u2192 Freedom (e.g., \u2192 ) Note: This is how we can alter the auto sent with non-damaging abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you \"off\" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H auto with Freedom . \u2b25 Generally speaking, the only defensive Autos you will do are with your ultimates like Sunshine , special attacks like ZGS , and Freedom due to it giving two autos \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Though in cases of maximizing adrenaline gain when building you would want to exploit as many as possible as you will generate more adrenaline overall relative to normal abilities due to you getting the auto adrenaline ontop of the normal abilities adrenaline gains Application: 4TAA Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., \"Average Ability\") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it What it is \u2b25 4-tick auto Attack (4TAA) is an extension of weapon juggling wherein, as the name implies, you force an auto attack on the 4th tick after casting the ability before \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This largely applies to Magic, but can be extended to casting Debuff spells with non-Magic too \u2b25 As mentioned earlier, when you cast a damaging ability it will put your autos on cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 4t cooldown after a fastest speed (Wand) ability, 6t after an average speed (Staff) ability \u2b25 So, to 4TAA we make use of this fact, along with the fact that Magic can force an auto + ability on the same tick due to having access to spell (and so auto) binds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We make use of this by delaying our next ability by a tick to force an auto and ability on the 4th tick How it Works \u2b25 The general 4TAA structure will be like: 2H auto + Avg/Fastest Ability \u2192 non-channeled Fastest Ability \u2192 Repeat \u2b25 As you can see, the auto is forced every other ability, this is simply due to the fact that 2H autos have a 6t cooldown so you can only cast it after every other ability \u2b25 Further, you can see the ability before it repeats has to be a non-channeled Fastest ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It must be a Fastest ability due to the 4t auto cooldown associated with it, allowing you to do a 2H auto 4t later \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It must be non-channeled because each hit of a channel resets your auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Thus it is generally ideal to always do an auto into your channeled ability \u2b25 Moreover, you can see that after an auto you can do either an Average or a Fastest ability, this is because it does not particularly matter assuming same perks and tier \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 That being said, you must (outside of very niche cases) always ensure that when you do an auto into a channel that the channeled ability is done with Fastest (this is mostly important for Asphyxiate ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is because of the fact that when the channeled hits reset your auto cooldown, it is going to reset it based off the weapon you are wearing. So, if you staff , when your ends your auto is on a 6t cooldown still \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The table below will showcase two different scenarios: Staff (Average) Asphyxiate: You MUST do: Auto + Asphyxiate \u2192 Ability \u2192 Fastest Ability \u2192 Auto + Ability Wand (Fastest) Asphyxiate: You can do: Auto + Asphyxiate \u2192 Fastest ability \u2192 Auto + Ability Application: 5TAA Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., \"Average Ability\") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it What it is \u2b25 This is pretty similar to 4TAA, but for Melee and Ranged, in that you are essentially delaying your next ability to get an auto in; however, a key difference is that Melee and Ranged do not have an auto bind, and so must wait an additonal tick before casting their ability \u2b25 So, instead of doing: T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability T4: Auto + Ability \u2b25 You do T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability T4: Auto auto-casts T5: Ability \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Melee: \u2192 (wait 4t) auto fires \u2192 (wait 1t) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Range: \u2192 (wait 4t) auto fires \u2192 (wait 1t) \u2b25 The reason for this is because Autos normally are executed after abilities in a tick, so using an ability on the same tick it is casted will override it as it incurs the auto cooldown, hence the need to delay the ability an additional tick to get the auto in \u2b25 The use cases are far more limited to 4TAA which you regularly weave in. 5TAA is primarily done to align ticks, this is most notably seen in Berserk rotations that use one 7t channel (e.g., 4-hit Destroy ) without the ability to use a 5t (3.0s/3-hit) Greater Flurry to align ticks, as can be seen below: T0: Zerk T3: Ability T6: Ability T9: 7t channeled Ability T16: Ability T19: Ability T22: Fastest non-channeled Ability T26: Auto auto-casts T27: Ability T30: Ability T33: Ability + Zerk ends \u2b25 \u200e \u200eAs you can see in the above table, by using a 5TAA it was possible to get an ability on the last tick of , this then allows any ability to hit outside of and thus get both and Berserker Aura damage modifiers \u2b25 It is important to note that like 4TAA, the ability before must be a fastest non-channeled ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further the ability before that cannot be a slower-than-fastest channeled ability for the same reasons as to why staff Asphyxiate causes issues with 4TAA \u2b25 Video Demonstration of Berserk with 5TAA to align ticks: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192

\u2192 \u2192 (4-hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (fastest) \u2192 \u2192 Difference in the Above Clips \u2b25 As seen, they both follow the same ability order, except the first has an auto, and the other has a non-boosted Decimate after Quake \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the clip where 5TAA is used, does more damage (8451 vs 7644) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is because by making using of 5TAA it was possible to realign the Zerk rotation to get an ability on the last tick of to get the Ultimate and Aura buff \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Doing a 7t (4.2s) channel will require you to do this to realign to last tick of \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- An alternate way to realign is to use a 5t (3.0s) channel \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The after the was used to display how you cannot fit another ability by skipping the auto anyway, so to make full use of ticks you want to 5TAA \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The benefits of this is gone in more in depth in this video by #Aiex: https://youtu.be/AzswBOuBnUQ Dark Bow Autos Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., \"Average Ability\") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it Why Dark Bow Autos are Interesting \u2b25 Dark Bows are interesting in that they cast 2 autos at once, and this is balanced around the fact that it has a 12t (7.2s) cooldown, and as such they are primarily used for adrenaline gain in conjunction with defensives to maximize adrenaline gain. \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u2192 \u2192 swap \u2192 \u2b25 Further, as mentioned, Ranged auto cooldowns follow a different system from Melee and Magic, in that the cooldown is only based on the last auto or ability fired, therefore the following is possible for even more adrenaline gain: T0: Fastest Piercing T3: Freedom + OH Auto T4: Dbow Auto auto-casts t6: Fastest Needle T9: Anticipate T10: Dbow Auto auto-casts \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u2192 \u2192 (wait 1t) swap \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 swap \u2b25 Additionally, this can also be used for damage assuming accuracy permits, with the aforementioned cooldown interactions you can do what is called C5TAA, or continous 5 tick auto attacks, and as the name implies you continously cycle the autos, as shown below: T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability T4: Dark Bow Auto cast T5: Fastest non-channeled Ability T9: Dark Bow Auto auto-casts T10: Ability

practical usage due to the existence of ECB , along with the fact it is pretty intensive, that being said you can also just use them for regular defensive autos should you not be in , and accuracy and inventory space permits, as follows: T0: Fast/Fastest non-channeled Ability T3: Death's Swiftness T4/5: Dark Bow Auto auto-casts T6: Ability \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: \u2192 + swap Application: Stalling Click vs auto Bind Release \u2b25 There are two ways to release a stalled ability (in the context of stalling an ability and clicking under yourself so your character does not run in to release it by themself) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first is clicking to release \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The second is using an auto to release, which will be the focus \u2b25 Essentially, when you click to release you are limited to stalling and releasing on the same target, and further like clicking autos you cannot click release and use an ability on the same tick - but you can release mid GCD \u2b25 Video Demonstration: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities used in clip: stall \u2192 Click (releases )

attacks"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/auto-attacks/#cooldown","text":"Brief Introduction \u2b25 Generally speaking casting an ability will reset the auto's cooldown, and for channels each casted hit resets it. Cooldowns Work as Follows \u2b25 \u200e \u200eEvery weapon has a weapon speed tied to it. This is used to determine the auto's cooldown based on the auto or ability fired: Speed (cooldown in ticks/seconds) Slowest (12t/7.2s) Average (6t/3.6s) Fast (5t/3.0s) Fastest (4t/2.4s) Note: There are exceptions to if, when, and how abilities incur the cooldown, these will be discussed later Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., \"Average Ability\") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it How Cooldowns Work with Melee and Magic \u2b25 For Melee and Magic it is best to think of the auto cooldown system as one where the cooldowns set overlap, and only when all these overlapping cooldowns end can you cast an auto. Let us look at a couple scenarios and talk about why they would or would not work: Scenario 1 (Will Not Work): Average Auto + Fastest Ability \u2192 (4t) Auto + Ability \u2b25 This will not work, why? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Avg. Auto applies a 6t cooldown and the Fastest Ability applies a 4t cooldown, these overlap \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the GCD ends there will still be 3t of cooldown left from the Avg. Auto and 1t from the Fastest Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Waiting 1t more means the Auto is still on a 2t cooldown from the Avg. Auto, though the cooldown applied by the Fastest Ability has ended \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Hence, you cannot Auto 4t after the Fastest Ability despite it applying a 4t cooldown, since there is still 2t of cooldown remaining from the Avg Auto Scenario 2 (Will Work): Average Auto + Average Ability \u2192 Fastest Ability \u2192 (4t) Auto + Ability \u2b25 This will work, why? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Avg. Auto and Ability will both apply an overlapping 6t auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Fastest Ability after will apply a 4t cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- At this point the cooldowns from the Average Auto and Ability from before are at 3t remaining \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 By the time the GCD after this Fastest Ability ends, the cooldown set by the initial Average Auto and Ability end \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- However, 1t of cooldown remains from the Fastest ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, you must wait 1t more, and so 4t the Auto after, in order to actually get it as it will be off cooldown only then How Cooldowns Work with Ranged Work \u2b25 It is worth reiterating that this system of overlapping cooldowns only applies to Melee and Magic \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ranged simply just uses the cooldown set by the last thing cast, auto or ability, due to a bug that was never patched with it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This means in Scenario 1 with Ranged you would be able to 4t the auto rather than waiting the full 6t. How Channeled Abilities Interact with the auto Cooldown \u2b25 You can think of each hit of a channeled ability being \"cast\" where each cast incurs the auto cooldown as expected Exceptions \u2b25 \u200e \u200eAs mentioned, there are exceptions when it comes to abilities that affect the cooldown. Abilities that incur the cooldown on cast are typically referred to as \"damaging abilities\", there are also \"non-damaging abilities\" which exist that do not, they are as follows: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Note: ZGS Spec is actually a damaging ability, and hence it would try to drag you in like one; however, it does not actually affect the auto cooldown, hence why it is listed here Note: Unlike normal non-damaging abilities, Freedom will always give you an off-hand auto on cast with it \u2b25 \u200e \u200eMoreover, there are other abilities that affect or interact with the cooldown in unexpected ways, they are as follows: , , , (+ ),","title":"Cooldown"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/auto-attacks/#in-depth-look-at-these-unexpected-abilities","text":"Tsunami and Omnipower \u2b25 Tsunami and Omnipower works as follows: T0: Average/Fastest Nami/Omni cast T5: Fastest cast Nami/Omni Auto cast T6: Average cast Nami/Omni Auto cast \u2b25 Essentially, if you cast / with an Average speed weapon (Staff), the auto cooldown will be affected as expected \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, if you cast it with a Fastest speed weapon (Wand), the auto cooldown will be delayed a tick further than normal Shadow Tendrils \u2b25 Shadow Tendrils is technically a damaging ability, but unlike normal damaging abilities it incurs the auto cooldown later, either 2t (1.2s) after you activate it, this is when it is cast, or 3t (1.8s) after activation, which is when it hits \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you do a fastest , it will reset the auto cooldown on t3, otherwise t2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you do your weapon swap input <2t after (where is activated on t0) it will use the new weapon speed's auto cooldown, otherwise it will use the weapon you casted with's auto cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because of this, like a non-damaging ability you can get an auto cast during the GCD \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Unlike non-damaging abilities, to get this lossless auto the ability before must be cast with a fastest weapon and also non-channeled \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Further, unlike normal non-damaging abilities, if you offed (this will be explained later) you will have to spam click after casting to get the auto.

Ability\") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it What it is \u2b25 This is pretty similar to 4TAA, but for Melee and Ranged, in that you are essentially delaying your next ability to get an auto in; however, a key difference is that Melee and Ranged do not have an auto bind, and so must wait an additonal tick before casting their ability \u2b25 So, instead of doing: T0: Fastest

fires \u2192 (wait 1t) \u2b25 The reason for this is because Autos normally are executed after abilities in a tick, so using an ability on the same tick it is casted will override it as it incurs the auto cooldown, hence the need to delay the ability an additional tick to get the auto in \u2b25 The use cases are far more limited to 4TAA which you regularly weave in. 5TAA is primarily done to align ticks, this is most notably seen in Berserk rotations that use one 7t channel (e.g., 4-hit Destroy ) without the ability to use a 5t (3.0s/3-hit) Greater Flurry to align ticks, as can be seen below:

be a slower-than-fastest channeled ability for the same reasons as to why staff Asphyxiate causes issues with 4TAA \u2b25 Video Demonstration of Berserk with 5TAA to align ticks: \u200e \u200e \u200e

(8451 vs 7644) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is because by making using of 5TAA it was possible to realign the Zerk rotation to get an ability on the last tick of to get the Ultimate and Aura buff \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Doing a 7t (4.2s) channel will require you to do this to realign to last tick of \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- An alternate way to realign is to use a 5t (3.0s) channel \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The after the was used to display how you cannot fit another ability by skipping the auto anyway, so to make

Alternatively if you're constantly moving you can spam it once per tick. Walking Bosses (Courtesy of #pavu) Moving NPCs \u2b25 In RS, bosses only walk East, West, or South (never North). The direction they walk is random at first, but they will always walk in that direction afterwards. \u2b25 Hitting a wall changes walking behavior in the following ways: an east-walking boss will turn west, a west-walking boss will turn south, and a south-walking boss will turn either east or west. The Araxxor Walking Guide demonstrates this behavior: https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k Applications \u2b25 The simplest of these includes walking a bleed such as Combust , Fragmentation Shot , or Slaughter . Below is a demonstation of this (Courtesy of #ykro): https://youtu.be/0Y0JGMeLcmI Note: A more advanced version of this is using a bleed, and then immediately using Surge to go under the boss and Bladed Dive to get back all within a GCD. This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD. \u2b25 Walking can also be used to reposition a boss, such as fixing base spot on P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out of green bomb mists, and moving Telos out of beams. Note: Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don\u2019t want to walk, you should move an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement. Manual Spell Casting (Courtesy of #Linie and #nadir) Saving Rune Costs \u2b25 Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to. The Surge , Blitz , and Barrage spells deal damage scaling up to T92 while other spells are capped at a lower tier. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Particularly, the Aurora spells are capped at T90 damage and below, making them undesirable to use despite their secondary effects. \u2b25 However, this issue is resolved with manual spell casting found in the combat settings. This toggle makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell. \u2b25 Without this toggle, if the player's spell is set to Blood Barrage and they use Ruby Aurora , their autocast spell will be set to the latter, capping all damage they deal from T92 down to T90. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With manual spell casting toggled, the autocast spell stays locked on Blood Barrage , keeping ability damage set to T92 regardless of what spell the player manually inputs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with. Applications \u2b25 On the normal spellbook, this allows the player to attack with Air Strike instead of Air Surge (although the autocast spell must still be set to Surge), reducing rune costs from 5 Air Runes per attack down to 1. \u2b25 On Ancients, the Aurora spells can be used while maintaining T92 damage, so long as the player's autocast spell is set to a Blitz or Barrage spell. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ruby Aurora is the most useful of the set as it increases the damage of nearby teammates by up to 3%. This effect has existed for a long time but it was used at a DPS loss to the caster. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Emerald Aurora provides damage reduction up to 5% on a personal basis, potentially allowing some use in a solo pvm situation. \u2b25 Blood Burst, the lower tier of Blood Barrage , can also be used to save on rune costs and have the same damage and effects of Barrage under manual spell casting. \u2b25 At Telos, manual spell casting may be used to prevent the player from accidentally auto attacking with an Ice spell when it may be undesirable to do so. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Binding Telos in the black beam or breaking his Freedom at a poor time can be the result of using Ice Blitz earlier and having it set to the autocast spell with manual spell casting toggled off. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With the toggle on, the player has increased control over when to bind Telos and potential ping spikes won't have as much of an unintended consequence. Autocast Spell Selection (Courtesy of #Lord Tywin I) Ensuring Both Weapons are Casting Spells \u2b25 When selecting an autocast spell, be sure to manually select it with dual-wield (main-hand + off-hand). Selecting your autocast with a two-handed weapon will only apply it to the main-hand, thus setting no off-hand spell, causing you to do 2/3 damage when doing dual-wield abilities in this manner. \u2b25 Here is a comparison. First example is selecting your autocast with two-handed weapon first (main-hand autocast). Second example is selecting your autocast with dual-wield weapon first (main-hand + off-hand autocast). https://youtu.be/IUmvGm4Z374 Boss Centre and AoE (Courtesy of #Foxis) Boss Center Square is Always South-West \u2b25 This affects abilities like Corruption blast , Corruption Shot , and Detonate . On something like a combat dummy, the true centre is in the centre because the size of the dummy is 1 square, but any monster 2 by 2 or larger has a south-west centre. \u2b25 In picture A, the Detonate green arrows are on the centre of the Dragon, meaning the Dragon to the North will not be hit by the ability. \u2b25 In picture B, the arrows are perfectly aligned and will allow detonate to hit both Dragons. This means you should always try to Detonate a monster that is north east of another monster to maximize the amount of targets hit. \u2b25 Here is a general diagram showcasing the above visuals in the context of a 3x3 AoE being used: Note that this works with other forms of AoE as well, such as Mechanised chinchompas .

After that, defensive basics will no longer give adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is an important caveat: you will only be unable to gain adren for 10 seconds. After that, you can use ONE defensive basic that will give you adren, after which you will be unable to gain adren again for 10s. Think of this as a cooldown - 10s after the last damaging ability on a boss, you will only be able to build once every 10s. The following abilities do not affect or reset this \u201ccooldown\u201d: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (Surge , Escape , and Bladed Dive ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Defensive thresholds (these will always take 15 adren unless you lose target, and their use does not affect the CD) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Ultimates that do not require a target \u2b25 An example showcasing the latter (ultimates not affecting this cooldown) would be not losing target after an AoD kill, then starting off the next kill with Sunshine + a defensive basic that was used NO earlier than 10s after the previous defensive basic you used to stall adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You would be able to use Anticipate to stall, Sunshine when your Anticipate timer is at 2s, then use another defensive basic like Freedom after Anticipate has run out. Note that all this does not apply on targets that automatically force you to lose target after death (e.g. Araxxi and Telos) Ability Stalling (Courtesy of #pavu) Stacking Abilities \u2b25 The act of activating an ability outside your weapon's cast distance, \"holding\" the ability, and finally releasing it. Short video guide on this topic: https://youtu.be/fInvWvnSI18 Weapon Poison (Courtesy of #FriggityFrank) How it Works \u2b25 Weapon Poison provides a buff to the player for an amount of time dependent on the grade of poison being used. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 While this is active, players have a 12.5% chance of poisoning a target so long as they are not poison-immune. After being poisoned, the target will take damage every 16 game ticks, or 9.6 seconds, and will continue to take damage for 3 minutes. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This 3 minute duration also has a chance to be refreshed at a 12.5% rate. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Poison damage will hit 2 ticks after the damage that applied it. \u2b25 Vulnerability affects this damage, but prayers and damage boosting ultimates do not. \u2b25 Cinderbane Gloves heavily boost the amount of damage that can be dealt by poison. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 While worn, the gloves effectively ignore the 16 tick cooldown on poison damage, allowing for a 12.5% chance of reapplication and refreshing the poison timer on the target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This reapplication will incur an extra poison hit, and the 16 tick damage timer is also reset. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This effect also allows for poison to reapply itself, so each poison hitsplat also has a 12.5% chance of dealing an extra poison hit and refreshing the timer. \u2b25 Without using weapon poison, the damage supplied by Cinderbane Gloves' own poison will be closer to that of Weapon Poison+. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, they increase the damage that applied weapon poison deals. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The +++ variant is increased to an average 36.5% ability damage from 27.9%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Coupled with Kwuarm incense sticks, this value raises further to 46.5%. \u2b25 Laniakea's Spear greatly compliments Cinderbane Gloves' effect, greatly increasing the application rate of poison. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The application rate of poison is boosted by an additive 5%, increasing it to 17.5%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~21.2%, up from ~14.3%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Poison damage is increased by 5% as well, but only effects the final value and not the damage range. \u2b25 Poison can be applied/refreshed by any player-sourced damage . This includes: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Auto attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 God books \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Reflect damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blood necklaces \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cannon damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Puncture bleeds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Poison damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Wyvern Crossbow passive \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Eldritch Crossbow special \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dominion mines \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blood Reaver passive Zerk Auras and On-Cast Ult Interactions (Courtesy of #Archeus) Normally throughout your Sunshine, Death's Swiftness, and Berserk, the 10% damage increase from your Maniacal, Reckless, and Berserker Auras do not come into effect. However, there is a caveat in which you can get both the Ultimate boost and Aura boost, which is colloquially referred to as \"last tick of ult.\" \u2b25 Since the listed ultimates apply their buff on cast while the listed auras apply their buff on hit, by simply casting an ability in your ultimate and it hitting after the ultimate lets it get buffed by the 10% from aura too since the ultimate is now over and the buff can be applied. \u2b25 Notice the following image: the same ability is cast, yet one hit significantly harder, that is because of this interaction \u2b25 It is also important to take caution when using queuing, for if you queue something it delays the cast by 1 tick \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can cause issues when trying to cast an ability on the final tick of an ultimate to get the ultimate and aura damage modifiers stacking, as it makes your ability cast after the ultimate ends, rather than on the final tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can be seen in the following video clip (courtesy of #Mia Groves): The ability rotation being done is: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (4-hit) \u2192 (3-hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As can be seen, despite no ticks being lost, the at the start of dealt 3977 but the one on the final tick of dealt 2185 as it was actually casted out of due to this interaction. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The solution to it as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Firstly, you can just not queue an ability that will be casted on the last tick of your ultimate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Secondly, you can turn queuing off Grimoire and Scrimshaw Switching Obtaining both pocket slot's benefits Due to the fact that damage critical hits are calculated as an ability is fired, but modifiers like scrimshaw are calculated when an ability hits, it is possible to obtain the boosts of Erethdor's Grimoire at the same time as a Scrimshaw. This can result in roughly a 6% increase in damage across the course of an entire rotation, but will significantly increase the amount of inputs. \u2b25 Inputs for grimshaw with 4taa, in order (bracket groups indicate inputs in a single tick): [Have Active Grimoire + Staff Equipped ] \u2192 [ \u2192 Ability \u2192 Equip and activate Scrimshaw] \u200e \u200e\u2192 [Equip Grimoire and Activate Grimoire ] [Have Active Grimoire + DW Equipped ] \u2192 [Ability \u2192 Equip and activate Scrimshaw] \u200e \u200e\u2192 [Equip Grimoire and Activate Grimoire + Equip Staff ] Demonstration: https://youtu.be/M65xdRYYxJ4 Instance Hopping (Courtesy of #ykro) Why is it Useful \u2b25 Some boss encounters, such as the whole God Wars Dungeon 2, take place inside an private instance. Although useful to prevent world crowding from annoying you in PvM, there is a downside: Bosses will not respawn instantly inside it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is a method used to reduce the spawn time of the bosses, and it consists of: kill boss \u2192 pick loot if worth it \u2192 quickly leave instance \u2192 re-join instance \u2192 repeat Comparison of waiting for spawn time x instance hopping: https://youtu.be/O-Lb93vFRAI Note: Although the difference might seem small, over the course of multiple (30+ kills) it adds up significantly.

Note: Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don\u2019t want to walk, you should move an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement.","title":"Walking Bosses (Courtesy of #pavu)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/mechanics/#manual-spell-casting-courtesy-of-linie-and-nadir","text":"Saving Rune Costs \u2b25 Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to.

This toggle makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell. \u2b25 Without this toggle, if the player's spell is set to Blood Barrage and they use Ruby Aurora , their autocast spell will be set to the latter, capping all damage they deal from T92 down to T90. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With manual spell casting toggled, the autocast spell stays locked on Blood Barrage , keeping ability damage set to T92 regardless of what spell the player manually inputs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with.

Damage is king at AoD. As such, it is extremely important to have solid knowledge of rotations, as well as understand how to squeeze damage in at every opportunity. An AoD preset will be notably low in solid food, and have a significant amount of Blue Blubber Jellyfishes and Guthix Rests, as you are able to spam them during the kill to heal without losing adrenaline. Additionally, it is highly recommended to learn the boss with magic, as on a 7 man team, there will be 1-5 mages at any give time. However, Melee is also extremely viable at AoD and at the time of writing (2020/01/04) is considered meta on more experienced teams with 2-4 meleers on a team. At time of writing, it's encouraged to start at AoD 7-10 server, and end up in Nex AoD FC. Each kill of AoD is worth 3,862,500. Advanced players can get up to 21 kph, earning on average 81,112,497 gp/hr. Presets Salves are especially nice at AoD, as they save inventory space and also prevent the poison effect during the last 600k of the boss. An amulet of souls is used as you reach very high accuracy at AoD. If you do not 4tick at AoD (highly encouraged to learn to 4tick for this boss), then switches can be removed. Bladed Dive is critical to use during the last 600k in order to travel quickly between pillars around the arena. Each kill should be started at 100% adrenaline, which is why the preset contains an equipped ring of vigour and a cywir wand/ancient lantern (Planted Feet Switch). Beginner Preset \u2b25 Rune Pouch for entangle. Mage Ent As you become more familiar with the boss, you are able to incorporate spiritual prayer potions to spam Ripper demon specials, and also bring a dragon rider amulet switch for extra damage on dragon breath. Additionally, once you are familiar with entangle and have a solid understanding of the mechanics at the boss, you can start to do the hammer, chinner, and solo base roles. It is also entirely viable to not use spellbook swap, and should only be done when comfortable. The ancient lantern is used both as a shield switch and as a planted feet switch. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Elite Tectonic Robe bottom (barrows) Invigorating 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic Singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Dark Form Camp dark form the entire kill \u2b25 Essence of Finality Guthix staff spec stored \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Note: The scrimshaw of the elements can be replaced by a grimoire. Quaker/Melee ent Historically needed to hammer the boss during P2 but is no longer needed. Quaker is essentially a free melee who might need to quake the boss. Quaker should only quake if the team has someone off a berserker aura variant, doesn't have a mage or people do not own EoF. 2 rune pouches should be used to allow for group vengeance and disruption shield to be casted. Additionally, knowing how to do good damage with Melee is critical. Spiritual prayer can also be replaced with food if needed. Grimoire is best in slot, but can be replaced with a Saradomin Book or Armadyl book. A vampirism scrimshaw is strongly discouraged, but if needed, can replace a piece of food as a switch. \u2b25 If melee ent, replace with \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Off-hand Drygore Mace Flanking 4 \u2b25 Essence of Finality \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Chinner As the chinner, your job is to help phasing along, and clear the minions while calling the order they die in. Range is used in conjunction with mechanical chinchompas to do this as efficiently as possible. Additionally, the chinner is expected to voke the boss if the base dies for some reason, as they use the least food during the kill overall (especially due to the ability to soul split minions). The multiple eofs are for Dark bow, Sgb, and hammer. Hydrix bolts can be used either on ruby bolt cooldown, or for only the last 600k, depending on how sweaty you'd like to be. Food and spiritual prayers can be adjusted as needed. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Off-hand Ascension Crossbow Flanking 4 \u2b25 Essence of Finality Statius Warhammer spec stored \u2b25 Essence of Finality Dark Bow spec stored \u2b25 Essence of Finality Seren Godbow spec stored \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Note: Chinner Hammers P1 Mage Solo Base In the current meta at the time of writing (2019/01/15), most AoD teams have a dedicated meat shield, the solo base. Responsibilities as a solo base are, positioning the boss to provide flanking, keeping the boss relatively centered, staying alive (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT), and dragging the boss away during pillars phase so that people are able to soul split their HP without getting mage autos. It is recommended to use a . However a mammoth can be used in conjunction with its scrolls to allow eating solids without losing adrenaline. Jellies and Guthix Rests are used to be able to combo eat big eats as well as for when burst healing is not needed. Spiritual prayers are used so that your scrolls have uptime when needed. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Tectonic Robe Bottom (barrows) Invigorating 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic Singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Dark Form Camp dark form the entire kill \u2b25 Essence of Finality Guthix staff spec stored \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) If using mammoth: Chin Base As Chinbase, your job is to Hammer P1 and during the second pillar, as well as hold aggro of the boss except for P1 and fartank as well. Beyond this, it is crucial to clear minions quickly to prevent entangles from getting second stuns. On P1 and P2 your job is to do damage and help phasing along.

However, as teams get faster, more and more mechanics are ignored in some way or another, changing how to respond to them. All of this information is how to handle mechanics in teams that are roughly 3:45 or faster. Elements Do not debil. When Nex starts the element spec, she will choose a quadrant, and that person will receive roughly 3500 x 3 damage. The optimal means of dealing with this spec is to turn on , \u200e \u200eUse to mitigate first hit, tank the second hit, and resonance the third. Generally, by this point, the boss will be phased. If not, switch back to and finish the phase. Reaver Replace an air surge with an entangle and continue DPSing Nex. It is likely that if you're not 4ticking, this section does not apply to you. In even faster teams, it is worthwhile learning how to freedom entangle. This involves hitting your entangle keybind and then quickly hitting your freedom keybind, forcing an offhand auto as entangle, binding the reaver.

Elements If you receive a second elements special, you are not in a team fast enough to benefit from the strategies listed here. Mechanic Handling in Faster Teams (P3-End) Mid Lure and Flanking Sun It is encouraged to do a flanking sun. By luring a minion directly to the middle of the octagon via surge, the sunshine is placed on the edges of the octagon. While this is a learner friendly tactic, the resulting sunshine is placed too far out on the edges of the octagon whereby some minion tanks can no longer flank in their sunshine. In a solo base team where Nex faces West, the Umbra and Glacies minion tanks cannot flank after they surge (without moving out of their sunshine). After your minion spawns do the following: surge, wait for your minion to run to the center, then walk behind Nex while staying inside the octogon. After the 1.8m phasing, activate Sun or the respective ultimate. With your new sun, you can walk freely within your octagon quadrant to get a flanking angle. See the diagram below for how this works. After detonating run to the spot shown in the picture below while attacking Nex so that dbreath hits both Nex and the amalgamation (standing on the amalg works fine but make sure you don't walk yourself). After the amalg dies lure the minion by surging through Nex, once the minion is in the middle you run to the sunshine spot and time it. Diagram on where to stand: Sun spot: Ice Call that you are iced to your team. Freedom and move to ensure that you do not hit any of your teammates, and wait for them to free you. Jump back into the fight as quickly as possible and start doing damage again. It is also possible to free yourself from this spec. If you get iced you can use a powerburst of acceleration to be able to move again via movement abilities. Alternatively you can use it to catch up if you are lagging behind your team during pillars. Freeing yourself from an icicle is very beneficial because not only does it allow you to be free from the damage of an icicle. It also means your team doesn't have to worry about where it is dropped and won't have to help you break the ice, speeding up the kill. Example of freeing from ice can be seen here: https://youtu.be/A8kCwwLCuw4 Smoke Lines This spec is best avoided by counting auto attacks. After Nex marks you, she will do three auto attacks* and the smoke line will spawn on the third auto attack tick. Note: the auto attack immediately after Nex initiates the smoke attack will not have an attack animation as she is still in her Smoke Crouching animation. For ease of keeping track, you could just look for two visible auto attacks from Nex and move away from the smoke line as she does her second visible auto attack. Note that a smoke line occupies two squares width adjacent to the direction they are coming from. For the North smoke, the smoke line will occupy the north line you are standing on as well as the north line one square west of you. For the East smoke, the smoke line will occupy the East line you are standing on as well as the East line one square South of you. Knowing this is crucial in safely placing a smoke line away from your teammates if you intend to stay near the octagon to continue dpsing. Pillars Generally, you should have use of both surge and bladed dive to maneuver around the arena as fast as possible. Last Pillar Place your sun at max cast distance away from the edges of the arena. If the entire team does this, bombs can be places on the edges of the arena without jeopardizing your teammates suns. This allows for quick bomb placements and quick access back to your sun after you safely place a bomb. Miscellaneous Tips (Courtesy of #Dhoggo, adapted by #Hoobs) \u2b25 Teams should have one designated debuffer to apply Vulnerability throughout the fight. This is usually the Umbra minion tank's job. Vuln should be applied at the start of the fight, to Umbra, at 1.8m after you surge, to each pillar, and at 600k near last pillar. The reason there is only one debuffer on the team is because every vuln auto is a lost auto attack. (as an Umbra tank you can vuln bomb Umbra to save time) \u2b25 While Reavers are stunned by ice, wrack will apply 188% average ability damage instead of 94% ability damage, making it as strong as a Dragonbreath but with a 3 second cooldown. This allows for Reavers to be killed fast provided they are still stunned by ice. \u2b25 On Amalgamations, every Steel Titan special can hit upwards of 4k damage which significantly contributes to a speedy phase. Titan targeting can be inconsistent and if possible, you should manually tell Titan to attack the Amalgamation. The way to do this is to first recall the Titan (whistle button in the familiar interface), then ordering it to attack (by pressing the claw button in the familiar interface). Make sure you have summoning points for the Titan to do its special attack. Also, be sure to set the auto fire rate to \"1\". \u2b25 For NPCs that occupy more than a 1x1 space, the \"center\" square for said target will be the South-West most square. For Nex, she occupies a 3x3 space and her \"center\" square is the South-West most square. When you are attacking with Mechanized Chins, the 3x3 AoE from the Chins will protrude from Nex's center (the South-West square). This means that if all minions are lured correctly and standing in the center of the octogon underneath Nex, they will be hit by the Chin AoEs. However, if a minion is mis-lured standing too far South or East (away from the Nex's South-West \"center\") the Chin AoEs will not reach the mis-lured minion. As Chinner, you should be aware of this and be prepared to single-target minions if any happened to be mis-lured \u2b25 Soul Split flicking is fairly easy to do at Nex throughout P3 (1.8m) and P4 (600k) and can save you some food in a pinch. When Nex casts a mage auto attack, the attack is pre-determined to either hit or splash immediately when she casts the mage auto attack. However, due to the auto attack travel time, the damage will not be applied to your character until the mage attack reaches your character. If the mage attack happens to splash, a shield icon will appear on your character immediately when Nex throws out her auto attack. Knowing this, if you see a shield icon appear on your character as Nex does a mage auto attack, you can flick to soul split knowing that that mage auto attack will splash on your character once it reaches you. If no shield icon appears as Nex does a mage auto attack, you know that the auto attack will hit and therefore, you should pray magic. See video attached to see this in action: https://youtu.be/RK5TQER2zeM \u2b25 Stacked Mage Attack. Due to how slow Nex's mage auto attacks travel and due to how large of an attack distance Nex has, it is possible to have two mage auto attacks stack and damage you on the same tick. This can be very dangerous during P4 (600k) when moving around pillars. If Nex first does a mage auto attack while you are at a far distance, then you surge and move in closer to her and Nex does a second mage auto attack, the second mage auto attack will have less travel distance to cover and will likely hit you as the first mage auto attack hits you (remember that the first mage auto attack has a longer travel path, but has more time to travel to you). Knowing this, be wary of stacked mage attacks while surging around the arena. \u2b25 1 Tick Bombs. During P4, the bomb mechanic will pulse every 3 ticks and therefore damage you every 3 ticks if you are caught in its blast radius. In the unfortunate scenario where there is a \u200e \u200emid bomb and you are marked for an instakill, it is possible to save yourself from the instakill \u200e \u200ewhile also not taking any bomb damage. To do this, you must surge into the center circle, spend \u200e \u200e1 tick standing in the center circle for the instakill mechanic, and move away from the center \u200e \u200ecircle via bladed dive within that same tick. This is referred to as \"1ticking\" a bomb. Note that \u200e \u200ethe instakill mechanic is applied 1 tick after the yellow bar is completely filled, not as the yellow bar fills. This is crucial in timing your surge/bladed dive 1ticking. Old Rotations Note: Images of rotations are listed next to the date they were archived.

An AoD preset will be notably low in solid food, and have a significant amount of Blue Blubber Jellyfishes and Guthix Rests, as you are able to spam them during the kill to heal without losing adrenaline. Additionally, it is highly recommended to learn the boss with magic, as on a 7 man team, there will be 1-5 mages at any give time. However, Melee is also extremely viable at AoD and at the time of writing (2020/01/04) is considered meta on more experienced teams with 2-4 meleers on a team. At time of writing, it's encouraged to start at AoD 7-10 server, and end up in Nex AoD FC. Each kill of AoD is worth 3,862,500.

This is usually the Umbra minion tank's job. Vuln should be applied at the start of the fight, to Umbra, at 1.8m after you surge, to each pillar, and at 600k near last pillar. The reason there is only one debuffer on the team is because every vuln auto is a lost auto attack. (as an Umbra tank you can vuln bomb Umbra to save time) \u2b25 While Reavers are stunned by ice, wrack will apply 188% average ability damage instead of 94% ability damage, making it as strong as a Dragonbreath but with a 3 second cooldown. This allows for Reavers to be killed fast provided they are still stunned by ice. \u2b25 On Amalgamations, every Steel Titan special can hit upwards of 4k damage which significantly contributes to a speedy phase. Titan targeting can be inconsistent and if possible, you should manually tell Titan to attack the Amalgamation. The way to do this is to first recall the Titan (whistle button in the familiar interface), then ordering it to attack (by pressing the claw button in the familiar interface). Make sure you have summoning points for the Titan to do its special attack. Also, be sure to set the auto fire rate to \"1\". \u2b25 For NPCs that occupy more than a 1x1 space, the \"center\" square for said target will be the South-West most square. For Nex, she occupies a 3x3 space and her \"center\" square is the South-West most square. When you are attacking with Mechanized Chins, the 3x3 AoE from the Chins will protrude from Nex's center (the South-West square). This means that if all minions are lured correctly and standing in the center of the octogon underneath Nex, they will be hit by the Chin AoEs. However, if a minion is mis-lured standing too far South or East (away from the Nex's South-West \"center\") the Chin AoEs will not reach the mis-lured minion. As Chinner, you should be aware of this and be prepared to single-target minions if any happened to be mis-lured \u2b25 Soul Split flicking is fairly easy to do at Nex throughout P3 (1.8m) and P4 (600k) and can save you some food in a pinch. When Nex casts a mage auto attack, the attack is pre-determined to either hit or splash immediately when she casts the mage auto attack. However, due to the auto attack travel time, the damage will not be applied to your character until the mage attack reaches your character. If the mage attack happens to splash, a shield icon will appear on your character immediately when Nex throws out her auto attack. Knowing this, if you see a shield icon appear on your character as Nex does a mage auto attack, you can flick to soul split knowing that that mage auto attack will splash on your character once it reaches you. If no shield icon appears as Nex does a mage auto attack, you know that the auto attack will hit and therefore, you should pray magic. See video attached to see this in action: https://youtu.be/RK5TQER2zeM \u2b25 Stacked Mage Attack. Due to how slow Nex's mage auto attacks travel and due to how large of an attack distance Nex has, it is possible to have two mage auto attacks stack and damage you on the same tick. This can be very dangerous during P4 (600k) when moving around pillars. If Nex first does a mage auto attack while you are at a far distance, then you surge and move in closer to her and Nex does a second mage auto attack, the second mage auto attack will have less travel distance to cover and will likely hit you as the first mage auto attack hits you (remember that the first mage auto attack has a longer travel path, but has more time to travel to you). Knowing this, be wary of stacked mage attacks while surging around the arena. \u2b25 1 Tick Bombs. During P4, the bomb mechanic will pulse every 3 ticks and therefore damage you every 3 ticks if you are caught in its blast radius. In the unfortunate scenario where there is a \u200e \u200emid bomb and you are marked for an instakill, it is possible to save yourself from the instakill \u200e \u200ewhile also not taking any bomb damage. To do this, you must surge into the center circle, spend \u200e \u200e1 tick standing in the center circle for the instakill mechanic, and move away from the center \u200e \u200ecircle via bladed dive within that same tick. This is referred to as \"1ticking\" a bomb. Note that \u200e \u200ethe instakill mechanic is applied 1 tick after the yellow bar is completely filled, not as the yellow bar fills. This is crucial in timing your surge/bladed dive 1ticking.","title":"Miscellaneous Tips (Courtesy of #Dhoggo, adapted by #Hoobs)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/nex-aod/aod/#old-rotations","text":"Note: Images of rotations are listed next to the date they were archived.

The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name. \u2b25 An unusual trait they all share is that they are immune to magic attacks.

Zaros Phase \u2b25 Upon the start of this phase, Nex activates Turmoil and heals herself for 33,333 (1/6) of her health to boost it up to 73,333. \u2b25 Nex does not have any unique special attacks in this phase and uses only her melee and magic autoattacks Further details on the mechanics can be found here: https://runescape.wiki/w/Nex/Strategies#The_phases Positioning Good positioning is the next best thing to focus on after learning the rotation. This is a simple layout of the path you will follow during the kill. Starting position \u2b25 The pink square is where the 1/3 will stand in the start of the kill. \u2b25 The blue square is where the 2/4 will stand in the start of the kill, they will also from here. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You will stand in these spots until either smoke phase ends or Nex moves towards you, after which you will go to the yellow squares to attack the minion (Fumus). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You don't want to be standing adjacent to each other incase one of you gets virus. Umbra \u2b25 It's not recommended to Surge diagonally across the middle to Umbra as it can mess up the path for duo kills. The only time you will Surge is on Ice phase, this is explained more below. \u2b25 Since the 1/3 will be using Incite , it is their job to lure and position Nex correctly. Blood \u2b25 Do not stand adjacent to each other at the start to reduce virus spread (described below) and the 1/3 must make sure to position themselves between Nex and Cruor on Blood phase so 2/4 may Flank General path during the kill Ice \u2b25 After ending Blood phase and killing Cruor, Nex will be in either one of 2 places depending if you lured correctly or not. If done correctly Nex will be in the red box as described in the 1st picture and you will run to melee distance of the minion Cruor as shown by the white box \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is important to only run MD of minion after it is killed and Nex is phased into Ice or it will follow you and the 2nd scenario will occur. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Standing in the white box will cause Nex to walk the Fragmentation Shot bleed. \u2b25 From here you will end Ice phase with a Shadow Tendrils + Snap Shot most of the time, if not just use a basic. \u2b25 You will then immediately Surge towards Glacies (angle your camera so that you can click Glacies as soon as you reach him). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If for any reason Nex comes into the red box as described in the 2nd picture, then you will carry out the Ice phase rotation while running towards Glacies as this will most likely kite Nex and dodge contain.

Try and run her if she\u2019s close to surging through the middle. Shadow Phase During shadow make your way over to the north-eastern safespot, one method is to phase her on the northern side then once she is phased make your way to the north-eastern safe spot whilst you're killing Umbra so you're not stuck taking shadow bleed damage at the safe spot for long. Once phased, try to stay MD/ 2 squares away from Nex so she can reach you instantly and begin siphoning. Blood Phase During her siphon, make your way over to the eastern safe spot whilst staying at an even number of squares so that if she does run to you, she won\u2019t run underneath you which could delay her attacks which could mean she won\u2019t sacrifice if everything lines up poorly. At the eastern safespot you can click Cruor during your Rapid Fire and it won\u2019t switch unless your ability ends or Nex phases. After she is phased, make your way over to the south-eastern safespot so she will follow you, allowing no tick loss during the transition from Blood to Ice as you\u2019ll want to be MD to Glacies during the beginning of Ice. Ice Phase : Once Cruor is dead, Surge to Glacies and stand MD to her. Zaros Phase Try not to run Nex too much whilst your book is off cooldown.

You can snipe when her Wings go up a 3rd time. Ice Phase Notes \u2b25 If you get prisoned before targeting Glacies you can target cycle to attack him. Zaros Phase Notes \u2b25 Disruption shield may be used if you are low on food. \u2b25 You can run Nex if low on food, but don't need to (and will end up walking book procs).

To start with, using your highest level slayer master is always advised, with the exception of Mandrith who only offers wilderness tasks. Some tasks are higher weighted than others, so the tables on the wiki should be used to check which tasks are more likely to appear, blocking the tasks that have high weight but low XP/h. Early Slayer tasks offer poor XP rates, so the player should aim to gain slayer XP from other methods, such as squashing Scarabs in Menaphos, Reaper tasks or completing quests. Most tasks below level 85 offer low XP mobs, however a greater demon task can be used to power level slayer with the aid of the Demon Flashmobs distraction & diversion. If the player with the greater demon task is the first person to tag the boss, they will recieve the full 22.4k XP, which can be increased to 33.6k XP with the scrimshaw of sacrifice. With these methods, low-level, poor XP tasks can be avoided. Since AoE damage is the king of slayer, a lot of lower and higher levelled slayer tasks are generally done with melee, with a halberd weapon, making melee the main overall style when slaying. However, both magic and ranged have their own sets of tasks that they are best for, especially at the higher end, so all three styles are recommended to be used. Presets Some basic presets are shown below Basic Melee Preset Basic Magic Preset Basic Ranged Preset https://i.imgur.com/E9ZWpX4.png Note: The gear shown above isn't indicative of what one should wear on every slayer task, as many tasks require specific gear or items, the presets are just a general idea of what to remember to take with you. Items in x box represent potions that should be taken to every task, weapons and amulets that should be considered are in y box. The z box is relevant for cannon-able tasks, and a box represents items that should be taken to all tasks, especially the slayer cape for a quick teleport to a slayer master. Action Bars Some base action bars are shown below Basic Melee Afk Bar Basic Magic Afk Bar Basic Ranged Afk Bar Note: Specific tasks may require their own action bars, due to requiring certain abilities like Devotion or Anticipate in a specific spot, or if AoE is not required. These bars should be taken as a baseline and not as the absolute best bar. The ranged bar assumes 1v1 combat, as AoE ranged is usually in the form of Mechanised Chinchompas . If gFury is not owned, shift everything up one slot and put Slice at the end. Slayer Tips General Tips and Tricks \u2b25 There are a lot of tasks that benefit from using aggression potions to lure mobs together, often in conjunction with the Dwarven Multicannon or Oldak Coil to achieve a stronger effect. \u2b25 Prayer restoring items, such as Super Restores or Super Prayer Renewals are extremely cheap, so prayers should always be used when slaying. \u2b25 As soon as the player hits 105 , the highest priority is to obtain the Dinosaur Tooth drop, a 1/800 drop from slayer creatures on Anachronia. The droprate is further boosted under the effect of the Osseous Roar, to 1/720. Whilst 105 is not required, the lowest level slayer creature on anachronia is level 90 , Venomous dinosaurs are easily afk-able and give high kph. The Dinosaur Tooth is used to build the slayer helmet stand, which allows the Slayer Helm buff to be available at all times without wearing it, making it extremely ideal for all slayer tasks. \u2b25 Slayer points should be spent \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Firstly on building a good block + prefer list, unlocking good tasks such as Nightmare creatures, and upgrading the Slayer Helm . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After that, tooltbelt upgrades for the seedicide, gold accumulator, bonecrusher and charming imp, then abilities such as broader fletching and crafting slayer rings. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the player plans to do Gargoyles early on, Finishing blows is a higher priority, however a Legendary Pet can be used for the same effect without purchasing the ability.

These mobs include Acheron Mammoths, Camel Warriors, Living Wyverns and Ripper Demons, where the first 3 will be broken down below, and Ripper demons in #ripper-demon . These creatures are different to other slayer mobs, having several mechanics and dealing large damage, and offering good XP and drops in return. Camel Warriors Stats \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 2186 + 721.3 HP \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 4768.8 \u2b25 Optimal kills per hour: 160 \u2b25 Optimal XP per hour : ~760k XP/h Desirable Drops \u2b25 For the slayer log, Camel Warriors drop their unique Camel Staff, a t85 staff that provides infinite fire runes. It is obtained at a rate of 1/2000 on task, and 1/10,000 off task. \u2b25 Camel warriors have a poor drop table, with low kills per hour this makes it a task to avoid for GP. Location and How to Get There \u2b25 Their natural habitat is on an island just east of Sophanem, accessible via an agility shortcut in the desert outside Sophanem. If the player has completed the Contact!, Jack of Trades and Icthlarin's Little Helper quests, a quick way to access them would be via the Menaphos lodestone, taking the bridge to Sophanem, then using the east wall shortcut to get outside. \u2b25 Camel Warriors are best killed inside a Player-Owned Slayer Dungeon, with 3 in a large room being ideal. Useful Items Whilst no special items are required to kill Camel Warriors, prayer restoring items like the Ancient Elven Ritual Shard can be used in conjunction with other methods of restoring prayer, due to the heavy prayer drain. Method \u2b25 Camel warriors have one main mechanic, similar to that of Glacors. After taking some damage, they split into 3 mirages, Blood, Smoke and Shadow mirages. These have their own unique effects, and attack with magic attacks. Shadow mirages drain the player's prayer points after charging the bar above their heads, Blood mirages heal the other mirages for ~900 HP per attack, and Smoke mirages cast the Confuse, Weaken and Snare spells on the player, reducing hitchance and damage by 5%, and freezing you in place for 10s. \u2b25 As mentioned above, killing them in the Player-Owned Slayer dungeon is the optimal way of killing Camel Warriors. Enter the large room with 100% adrenaline, and damage all 3 of the camel warriors to spawn their mirages. Exit the room, and wait for the mirages to stack up by the door, drop out of combat to losslessly Devotion and use Berserk + Adrenaline Renewal , enter the room and aoe the mirages down, using \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 , then thresholds to finish off the respawned Camel Warriors. This is a good time to use Tuska's Wrath and build adrenaline for the next wave. Once the camel warriors respawn, repeat the same method. Note: Camel Warrior mirages do not count as targets for Ruthless or Bladed Dive , so they do not refresh it's cooldown when killed. Therefore the Mobile perk is recommended.

In addition to this, they have a rich drop table, with each kill worth 46,374, making the tasks decent for GP alongside XP. Mammoths also provide a large amount of crimson and blue charms, dropping 4 at a time. Location and How to Get There Mammoths are located on the Mammoth Iceberg, accessible via a boat to the north of the Fremenik Lodestone. Useful Items \u2b25 Magic Notepaper - useful to note the tusks for extra GP. \u2b25 Dominion Mines - provide 20k extra damage every minute. Method \u2b25 Mammoths have 2 main special attacks, a charge, and a smite attack. The charge deals large melee damage, hits up to 3 times, and is indicated by the mammoth shaking and the blue bar above it's head fills up. To avoid this, simply pray and allow it to hit you, or move out of the way. The smite attack is caused by being outside of the mammoth's attack range when in combat with it, to deal with it stay melee distance as much as possible. \u2b25 Mammoths attack with both melee and range hits, range hits have the animation of the mammoth throwing a large ice rock at the player's location, and can be avoided by moving out of the way. They can also sometimes throw 3 rocks at a time, so make sure to pray or move. \u2b25 The best method to deal with Mammoths is to AoE as many of them as you can, using the Noxious Scythe for the extended range. Stand in the area shown below, sip an aggression potion, pray and use AoEs such as Hurricane , Bladed Dive , Quake , Cleave , and Meteor Strike to deal large AoE damage. Remember to put dominion mines down every minute, and utilise Berserk and Zgs Spec to deal more damage. Use lossless healing food such as Saradomin Brews and Blue Blubber Jellyfish to keep hp up, alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . Due to a low hitchance without a stab weapon, an accuracy boosting aura such as / should be used. \u2b25 Melee is the best way to kill mammoths, however magic with the Inquisitor's staff can also be viable. The strategy is less aoe-focused with magic, and make sure to stay in melee distance to avoid the smite attack. Try to use your Sunshine in an area where many mammoths can be reached, as to avoid getting smited. Presets \u2b25 Melee Preset \u2b25 Magic Preset Video Guide https://youtu.be/cOS7bORNsWs Living Wyverns Stats \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 1859 + 613.4 HP \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 1878.8 \u2b25 Optimal kills per hour: 600 (Magic), 550 (Melee) \u2b25 Optimal XP per hour : ~1.1m XP/h Desirable Drops \u2b25 Wyverns have a rich drop table, with each kill being worth 102,161. They are the best source of Wyvern bones, an ingredient for super prayer potions. \u2b25 For the slayer log, Wyverns are also killed for their unique drop, the Wyvern Crossbow . This is a powerful t85 crossbow, dropped at a rate of 1/2000 on-task and 1/10,000 off-task. Location and How to Get There Living Wyverns are located inside the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon, accessed via a rope in the south of the Skeletal Wyvern room. The easiest way to get there would be via the Port Sarim lodestone and run south to the dungeon entrance, then take the agility shortcut directly east of the ladder. Alternatively, the fairy ring A.I.Q can be used to get to Mudskipper Point. Useful Items \u2b25 To avoid the majority of the Wyvern's breath damage, a potion that blocks Wyrmbreath must be used, such as an overload salve variant or a Wyrmfire potion. \u2b25 Dominion Mines - used to deal 2 large hits every minute, significantly lowering the hp of one Wyvern. \u2b25 Bonecrusher - with the bonepicker upgrade from the Arc, this is extremely useful for picking up Wyvern bones, where they can be easily noted whilst continuing to kill Wyverns. \u2b25 Death Note Relic - Automatically notes dropped bones and ashes. With the bonepicker upgrade, this automatically picks up noted bones. Method \u2b25 The main mechanic to look out for when killing Wyverns is the frost % that builds up the more time you spend in the cave. Standing next to a lit fire reduces the frost quickly, but should only be done when required. The frost % has different effects depending on how cold the player is. When the player first enters, the Wyvern's poison damage will be large, hitting for up to 900 per hitsplat, however this is reduced to around 300 damage when the frost reaches 25%. After this, the Wyvern's auto-attack damage is increased up to 2500, and when the frost reaches 100% the player is frozen and stunned for 10 seconds. If this happens, the player should leave the cave, or use and immediately stand next to a fire. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is optimal to keep frost above 25% and below 100, and spend as little time as possible next to a fire \u2b25 Living Wyverns can hit quite hard with their range and magic auto-attacks, but in melee distance deal less damage. Wyverns are stunnable, so they can be stunned repeatedly to avoid taking damage at all. is used to regain lifepoints, and the Wyverns are fought in single combat. \u2b25 Melee - Melee is good at Wyverns, as being melee distance reduces the damage taken, and due to their low hp they can be killed extremely quickly when under the effects of Berserk . Utilising movement abilities such as Bladed Dive and gBarge should be prioritised, to hop quickly between the Wyverns. In the middle of the room there is a Wyvern spawn that is next to a fire, aim to attack that spawn when the frost is getting close to 100%. Due to their spread spawns, usage of the Zgs Spec isn't recommended, however a TMW Spear can be utilised effectively to increase kph. Casting Slaughter and Dismember and moving on to another Wyvern is recommended if the hits are high, and if utilising gBarge , bled thresholds can be applied from a distance to high hp targets. \u2b25 Magic - Magic is the best style at wyverns, due to their weakness to the Inquisitor's staff . Stand close to a fire, and simply damage Wyverns within range. Wyverns are stunnable and bindable, so Ice Blitz + Wrack can be a powerful combo. Blood spells help with healing, alongside Vampyrism aura if required. The fire directly to the west of the rope has a spawn that Dominion Mines can be placed next to every minute for two 7k hits.

It is obtained at a rate of 1/2000 on task, and 1/10,000 off task. \u2b25 Camel warriors have a poor drop table, with low kills per hour this makes it a task to avoid for GP. Location and How to Get There \u2b25 Their natural habitat is on an island just east of Sophanem, accessible via an agility shortcut in the desert outside Sophanem. If the player has completed the Contact!, Jack of Trades and Icthlarin's Little Helper quests, a quick way to access them would be via the Menaphos lodestone, taking the bridge to Sophanem, then using the east wall shortcut to get outside. \u2b25 Camel Warriors are best killed inside a Player-Owned Slayer Dungeon, with 3 in a large room being ideal. Useful Items Whilst no special items are required to kill Camel Warriors, prayer restoring items like the Ancient Elven Ritual Shard can be used in conjunction with other methods of restoring prayer, due to the heavy prayer drain. Method \u2b25 Camel warriors have one main mechanic, similar to that of Glacors. After taking some damage, they split into 3 mirages, Blood, Smoke and Shadow mirages. These have their own unique effects, and attack with magic attacks. Shadow mirages drain the player's prayer points after charging the bar above their heads, Blood mirages heal the other mirages for ~900 HP per attack, and Smoke mirages cast the Confuse, Weaken and Snare spells on the player, reducing hitchance and damage by 5%, and freezing you in place for 10s. \u2b25 As mentioned above, killing them in the Player-Owned Slayer dungeon is the optimal way of killing Camel Warriors. Enter the large room with 100% adrenaline, and damage all 3 of the camel warriors to spawn their mirages. Exit the room, and wait for the mirages to stack up by the door, drop out of combat to losslessly Devotion and use Berserk + Adrenaline Renewal , enter the room and aoe the mirages down, using \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 , then thresholds to finish off the respawned Camel Warriors. This is a good time to use Tuska's Wrath and build adrenaline for the next wave. Once the camel warriors respawn, repeat the same method. Note: Camel Warrior mirages do not count as targets for Ruthless or Bladed Dive , so they do not refresh it's cooldown when killed. Therefore the Mobile perk is recommended.

Due to this, and their mechanics, there are a few methods of dealing with them, which will be outlined below. Stats \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 2159.5 + 712.6 HP \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 2721.5 \u2b25 Optimal kills per hour: 1000 (Ranged) , 800 (Melee) \u2b25 Optimal XP per hour : ~2.7m Desirable Drops \u2b25 Ripper Demons have a valuable loot table; containing Wines of Zamorak, Rune salvage, coins and a variety of high level herbs, which make them one of the better tasks to do for gp. In addition to this, when killed with Binding Contracts in your inventory, they are captured and turned into a Binding Contract (Ripper Demon) which provides a large buff to the GP/h of Ripper Demons, currently adding an extra ... per kill. \u2b25 For the Slayer log, Ripper Demons also drop the mainhand and offhand Ripper Claws , Cursed Amascut Sand , the 5 Miner's journals \u200e \u200eand finally, the Parasitic orb; a Pet item that unlocks the Nipper Demon pet, dropped at a rate of 1/30,000 from Ripper Demons and 1/333 from Elite Ripper Demons This makes Ripper Demons 66,451 in pouches alone, this makes them a very good gp task. Location and How to Get There Located in the Ripper Demon cave, South-east of Al-Kharid through a shortcut near the eastern gate. Teleporting via the lodestone is quick and simple, if in combat an amulet of glory can be used to teleport to Al-Kharid. Useful Items \u2b25 Demon Slayer (Perk) - A 7% damage increase to all damage dealt to Demons. \u2b25 Demon Slayer (Ability) - For the next 10 seconds, all damage against Demons is increased by 15%, 60 seconds cooldown. \u2b25 Restocking Cannon Ability - Allows the to restock without requiring interaction. \u2b25 Laceration Boots - Allows the player to cast Bladed Dive with a 2h, making the AoE effect hit in a 5x5 area with a halberd equipped. \u2b25 Death Ward - 5% damage reduction when your life points are below 50%; 10% damage reduction when they are below 25%. This can be useful to aid the player's survivability, but is by no means a requirement. Method Mechanics Ripper Demons have a few mechanics: \u2b25 When engaged from a distance, immediately teleport to the player and cast Slaughter , which deals triple damage if the target moves. \u2b25 They also have a Special attack, where adrenaline is built via auto-attacks and shown on the bar above their heads, when this bar fills they jump, and land where the player is standing shortly after, dealing up to 32000 damage and usually resulting in instant kill. This can be avoided by moving away from where you were standing immediately upon seeing them jump. \u2b25 If the player is below 35% HP, all nearby Ripper Demons will immediately aggro to the player. If Devotion is not active, teleport immediately. \u2b25 When killed, spin around and hit any nearby players with weak rapid melee hits every tick in a 3x3 area, which can deal large damage if stood in. \u2b25 Currently there are multiple methods of killing Ripper Demons, from low intensity low KPH to high intensity high KPH. They can also be done AFK in a Player-Owned Dungeon and fought 1v1 in the cave, however those are extremely low kph methods and do not require explaining. The methods are explained below. Ranged Method \u2b25 Up to 1100 KPH \u2b25 Ripper Demons have a low affinity to ranged attacks, however due to Mechanised Chinchompas offering excellent AOE damage, Rippers can be done most effectively with ranged. This is done ideally with the usage of a melee combat training dummy, namely the ones only currently available off treasure hunter. Note: Ironmen can also attack treasure hunter dummies. \u2b25 To chin Ripper Demons effectively it requires good gear and good ability knowledge, alongside inventory management to increase profit with Binding Contracts. Starting with 100% adrenaline, stand in the most southern part of the first cave, as shown in the videos and image linked below. Pre-place the cannon to aggro the rippers in the room, start with Death's Swiftness and use dps rotations on the dummy. Place the cannon on the red square, stand on the yellow arrow and step into the yellow square, so that the dummy is placed on the blue square. Following the end of the ultimate, build to use Incendiary Shot and switch back to chins . This is a good time to use the Demon Slayer ability , to help upkeep damage and refund adrenaline. This will allow the next Death's Swiftness to have excess adrenaline, which can be used in conjunction with the Dark Bow special attack, stored in an Essence of Finality , which deals huge damage for 65% adrenaline. Super Guthix Brews and Blue Blubber Jellyfish are used to maintain hp, alongside using Devotion to block all melee hits for 20 seconds. There is a lot to keep in mind when chinning, it may take a few tries to get down the rotation consistently, so don't be discouraged! This method can also be done with a friend acting as a \"tank\", using Intercept and defensive abilities to reduce the damage the chinner is taking, making for a smoother time. \u2b25 When you get more comfortable with looting drops whilst continuing to deal damage, such as Wines of Zamorak or Blood runes, picking up sharks and placing them in the Pack Mammoth is strongly recommended to help increase the length of trips and extend the player's food supply, as they can be eaten losslessly with Mammoth Feast scrolls. \u2b25 General Rotation threshold rotation: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Note: More thresholds can be used with excess adrenaline generated from crit refunds following Incendiary Shot , however make sure not to over-use Dark Bow spec as it is heavy on adrenaline, use up to three times maximum if using Grimoire . Preset Range Cannon + Dummy Square Melee Semi-AOE Method \u2b25 Up to 700 KPH \u2b25 This method involves the usage of the aggression ability and the Ricochet ability to allow for the semi-aoe aspect, where the player fights Rippers 1v1 in the small room until Devotion is off-cooldown, before aggro-ing multiple Rippers in the large room to AoE down whilst taking no damage. This method is extremely consistent and easy to do, whilst remaining low risk. \u2b25 The rotation is as follows: \u2192 + Aggression ability \u2192 AoEs such as / / / \u2192 Fight 1v1 in the small room \u2192 C4 \u2192 \u2192 AoEs such as / / / \u2192 Repeat. \u2b25 Make sure to use Devotion after killing a target for it to be lossless. Laceration Boots are extremely powerful here, allowing the player to use Blade Dive with a Scythe , making for a large 5x5 AoE ability that resets cooldown upon the target dying, meaning it can be used often. \u2b25 Ricochet will always tag Rippers even though it will splash, and if the player does not own a ZGS , they can replace it with Annihilation EoF spec or Meteor Strike , however make sure to keep the Scythe on after using the Annihilation. To deal with Elite spawns, simply target them as the main focus, as Hurricane will hit them twice. Use the Demon Slayer ability during the non-zerk AoE. Preset Melee AOE Method \u2b25 Up to 800 KPH \u2b25 Similar to the semi-AoE method, full AoE relies on constant AoE abilities through the usage of Bladed Dive with Laceration Boots , but this method uses an Oldak Coil and Aggression potions to constantly upkeep Ripper aggression. Due to their hard hitting attacks, this method relies on healing through a Pack Mammoth with lossless food such as Blue Blubber Jellyfish / Guthix Rests , alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . \u2b25 Stand to the east of the cave, place the Oldak Coil on the red square shown in the image below, and step back east to the yellow square to attack the demons. Use the Berserk ability when you have Devotion active, similar to the previous method, and in between use ZGS spec and Meteor Strike to keep damage high. If attacking multiple demons without a damage boosting effect, this is a good time to use your Demon Slayer ability to help keep damage high. If all the Rippers in the room are dead, step north to the other yellow square to escape the spin and reduce damage taken. Alloy Spikes are useful here to provide more hitsplats for poison damage. \u2b25 Usage of auto-retaliate can be useful for situational 2h auto attacks. Dead Ripper Demons can still be clicked while performing their death spin attack, but cannot be targeted. This can sometimes make it difficult to target the correct Ripper Demon through clicking, making auto-retaliate a reasonable option here. Target Cycling can also be used, but will lose the easy access to a 2h auto attack. Preset Coil + Standing Areas Legacy Magic Method \u2b25 Up to 700 KPH \u2b25 This method also uses the dummy method like the ranged setup, but uses legacy blood burst with an Inquisitor's Staff to damage the Rippers. This can achieve ~700 KPH which is very good for an AFK method, but does require upfront gear investment in the form of an Inquisitor's staff. The method is mostly reliable, however can be prone to getting hit by the Ripper's special attack, where the player would need to move. Due to the nature of Blood spells' secondary targets taking reduced damage, if the player is active they should target attacking rippers to ensure no special attacks. Place the cannon and dummy in the same spot as the ranged method. \u2b25 The usage of a Unicorn Stallion is recommended to provide extra healing if necessary, alongside Blue Blubber Jellyfish or healing potions such as Super Guthix Brews / Saradomin Brews , as they will not severely delay your attacks. \u2b25 This method can reach higher XP/h than the melee method despite being lower kph, as a Scrimshaw of Sacrifice can be utilised effectively, as it does not affect Binding Contracts, maintaining a bulk of the profit. \u2b25 Make sure auto-retaliate is OFF. A lot of actions will stop you from automatically attacking the dummy in Legacy. As such, it will occasionally be necessary to click the dummy again (alternatively, the player can click the spell in their spellbook to cast their spell again without having to click the dummy, but this does not work while the 'manual spellcasting' option in the game settings is enabled). Having auto retaliate turned off ensures that you don't accidentally target the wrong NPC.

Useful Items \u2b25 Demon Slayer (Perk) - A 7% damage increase to all damage dealt to Demons. \u2b25 Demon Slayer (Ability) - For the next 10 seconds, all damage against Demons is increased by 15%, 60 seconds cooldown. \u2b25 Restocking Cannon Ability - Allows the to restock without requiring interaction. \u2b25 Laceration Boots - Allows the player to cast Bladed Dive with a 2h, making the AoE effect hit in a 5x5 area with a halberd equipped. \u2b25 Death Ward - 5% damage reduction when your life points are below 50%; 10% damage reduction when they are below 25%. This can be useful to aid the player's survivability, but is by no means a requirement.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"pvme-guides/slayer/ripper-demon/#method","text":"Mechanics Ripper Demons have a few mechanics: \u2b25 When engaged from a distance, immediately teleport to the player and cast Slaughter , which deals triple damage if the target moves. \u2b25 They also have a Special attack, where adrenaline is built via auto-attacks and shown on the bar above their heads, when this bar fills they jump, and land where the player is standing shortly after, dealing up to 32000 damage and usually resulting in instant kill. This can be avoided by moving away from where you were standing immediately upon seeing them jump. \u2b25 If the player is below 35% HP, all nearby Ripper Demons will immediately aggro to the player. If Devotion is not active, teleport immediately. \u2b25 When killed, spin around and hit any nearby players with weak rapid melee hits every tick in a 3x3 area, which can deal large damage if stood in. \u2b25 Currently there are multiple methods of killing Ripper Demons, from low intensity low KPH to high intensity high KPH. They can also be done AFK in a Player-Owned Dungeon and fought 1v1 in the cave, however those are extremely low kph methods and do not require explaining. The methods are explained below.","title":"Method"},{"location":"pvme-guides/slayer/ripper-demon/#ranged","text":"Method \u2b25 Up to 1100 KPH \u2b25 Ripper Demons have a low affinity to ranged attacks, however due to Mechanised Chinchompas offering excellent AOE damage, Rippers can be done most effectively with ranged. This is done ideally with the usage of a melee combat training dummy, namely the ones only currently available off treasure hunter. Note: Ironmen can also attack treasure hunter dummies. \u2b25 To chin Ripper Demons effectively it requires good gear and good ability knowledge, alongside inventory management to increase profit with Binding Contracts. Starting with 100% adrenaline, stand in the most southern part of the first cave, as shown in the videos and image linked below. Pre-place the cannon to aggro the rippers in the room, start with Death's Swiftness and use dps rotations on the dummy. Place the cannon on the red square, stand on the yellow arrow and step into the yellow square, so that the dummy is placed on the blue square. Following the end of the ultimate, build to use Incendiary Shot and switch back to chins . This is a good time to use the Demon Slayer ability , to help upkeep damage and refund adrenaline. This will allow the next Death's Swiftness to have excess adrenaline, which can be used in conjunction with the Dark Bow special attack, stored in an Essence of Finality , which deals huge damage for 65% adrenaline. Super Guthix Brews and Blue Blubber Jellyfish are used to maintain hp, alongside using Devotion to block all melee hits for 20 seconds. There is a lot to keep in mind when chinning, it may take a few tries to get down the rotation consistently, so don't be discouraged! This method can also be done with a friend acting as a \"tank\", using Intercept and defensive abilities to reduce the damage the chinner is taking, making for a smoother time. \u2b25 When you get more comfortable with looting drops whilst continuing to deal damage, such as Wines of Zamorak or Blood runes, picking up sharks and placing them in the Pack Mammoth is strongly recommended to help increase the length of trips and extend the player's food supply, as they can be eaten losslessly with Mammoth Feast scrolls. \u2b25 General Rotation threshold rotation: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Note: More thresholds can be used with excess adrenaline generated from crit refunds following Incendiary Shot , however make sure not to over-use Dark Bow spec as it is heavy on adrenaline, use up to three times maximum if using Grimoire . Preset Range Cannon + Dummy Square","title":"Ranged"},{"location":"pvme-guides/slayer/ripper-demon/#melee-semi-aoe","text":"Method \u2b25 Up to 700 KPH \u2b25 This method involves the usage of the aggression ability and the Ricochet ability to allow for the semi-aoe aspect, where the player fights Rippers 1v1 in the small room until Devotion is off-cooldown, before aggro-ing multiple Rippers in the large room to AoE down whilst taking no damage. This method is extremely consistent and easy to do, whilst remaining low risk. \u2b25 The rotation is as follows: \u2192 + Aggression ability \u2192 AoEs such as / / / \u2192 Fight 1v1 in the small room \u2192 C4 \u2192 \u2192 AoEs such as / / / \u2192 Repeat. \u2b25 Make sure to use Devotion after killing a target for it to be lossless. Laceration Boots are extremely powerful here, allowing the player to use Blade Dive with a Scythe , making for a large 5x5 AoE ability that resets cooldown upon the target dying, meaning it can be used often. \u2b25 Ricochet will always tag Rippers even though it will splash, and if the player does not own a ZGS , they can replace it with Annihilation EoF spec or Meteor Strike , however make sure to keep the Scythe on after using the Annihilation. To deal with Elite spawns, simply target them as the main focus, as Hurricane will hit them twice. Use the Demon Slayer ability during the non-zerk AoE. Preset","title":"Melee Semi-AOE"},{"location":"pvme-guides/slayer/ripper-demon/#melee-aoe","text":"Method \u2b25 Up to 800 KPH \u2b25 Similar to the semi-AoE method, full AoE relies on constant AoE abilities through the usage of Bladed Dive with Laceration Boots , but this method uses an Oldak Coil and Aggression potions to constantly upkeep Ripper aggression. Due to their hard hitting attacks, this method relies on healing through a Pack Mammoth with lossless food such as Blue Blubber Jellyfish / Guthix Rests , alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . \u2b25 Stand to the east of the cave, place the Oldak Coil on the red square shown in the image below, and step back east to the yellow square to attack the demons. Use the Berserk ability when you have Devotion active, similar to the previous method, and in between use ZGS spec and Meteor Strike to keep damage high. If attacking multiple demons without a damage boosting effect, this is a good time to use your Demon Slayer ability to help keep damage high. If all the Rippers in the room are dead, step north to the other yellow square to escape the spin and reduce damage taken. Alloy Spikes are useful here to provide more hitsplats for poison damage. \u2b25 Usage of auto-retaliate can be useful for situational 2h auto attacks. Dead Ripper Demons can still be clicked while performing their death spin attack, but cannot be targeted. This can sometimes make it difficult to target the correct Ripper Demon through clicking, making auto-retaliate a reasonable option here. Target Cycling can also be used, but will lose the easy access to a 2h auto attack. Preset Coil + Standing Areas","title":"Melee AOE"},{"location":"pvme-guides/slayer/ripper-demon/#legacy-magic","text":"Method \u2b25 Up to 700 KPH \u2b25 This method also uses the dummy method like the ranged setup, but uses legacy blood burst with an Inquisitor's Staff to damage the Rippers. This can achieve ~700 KPH which is very good for an AFK method, but does require upfront gear investment in the form of an Inquisitor's staff. The method is mostly reliable, however can be prone to getting hit by the Ripper's special attack, where the player would need to move. Due to the nature of Blood spells' secondary targets taking reduced damage, if the player is active they should target attacking rippers to ensure no special attacks. Place the cannon and dummy in the same spot as the ranged method. \u2b25 The usage of a Unicorn Stallion is recommended to provide extra healing if necessary, alongside Blue Blubber Jellyfish or healing potions such as Super Guthix Brews / Saradomin Brews , as they will not severely delay your attacks. \u2b25 This method can reach higher XP/h than the melee method despite being lower kph, as a Scrimshaw of Sacrifice can be utilised effectively, as it does not affect Binding Contracts, maintaining a bulk of the profit. \u2b25 Make sure auto-retaliate is OFF. A lot of actions will stop you from automatically attacking the dummy in Legacy. As such, it will occasionally be necessary to click the dummy again (alternatively, the player can click the spell in their spellbook to cast their spell again without having to click the dummy, but this does not work while the 'manual spellcasting' option in the game settings is enabled). Having auto retaliate turned off ensures that you don't accidentally target the wrong NPC.

Each mob offers a different level of AFK-ability and GP rates, so the choice of which to kill is up to the player. The types that are recommended to kill will be listed below. \u2b25 The Magister can also be killed on a Soul Devourer task at 115 slayer for 8000 XP, and can achieve decent XP/h rates, however the only benefit of being on-task is the use of , as the effect does not work on him. Desirable Drops \u2b25 Soul Devourers are one of the sources that drop the Key to the Crossing and Vital Sparks , adding a lot of value to each task. Keys are dropped at a rate of 1/75 on task, which can be increased to 1/60 with the usage of Sophanem Slayer dungeon drop enhancers. Vital sparks are uncommon drops, and can be doubled via the use of Vital Spark enhancers, which can be purchased with dungeoneering tokens alongside the key enhancers. \u2b25 In addition to this, Soul Devourers each have their own droptables, containing good alchables and other resources, making them consistent GP, which is auto-looted in the Sophanem dungeon. Location and How to Get There Soul Devourers are located in the Sophanem Slayer dungeon, shortcuts can be unlocked to make them easier to access, after navigating the dungeon once. The easiest way to get there would be a Sophanem Dungeon Teleport tablet, craftable after reaching T4 reputation in the any Menaphos district. If the player has completed the Contact!, Jack of Trades and Icthlarin's Little Helper quests, a quick way to access them would be via the Menaphos lodestone, taking the bridge to Sophanem, and then running south to the dungeon entrance. Useful Items \u2b25 Feathers of Ma'at - required to kill all the mobs in the Sophanem Slayer dungeon, bar the Magister. \u2b25 Sophanem Slayer Dungeon Drop Enhancers / Vital Spark Enhancers - Purchaseable with dungeoneering tokens for 10,000 and 1000 dungeoneering tokens respectively, these offer increased drops in the dungeon. The dungeon drop enhancers increase the rate of keys obtained, and the vital spark enhancers provides +1 on drop. General Method Melee Afk Bar Melee Preset Most of the mobs in the slayer dungeon can be reasonably afk'd with a decent melee setup, through the usage of the Scrimshaw of Vampyrism to provide healing.

Each mob offers a different level of AFK-ability and GP rates, so the choice of which to kill is up to the player. The types that are recommended to kill will be listed below. \u2b25 The Magister can also be killed on a Soul Devourer task at 115 slayer for 8000 XP, and can achieve decent XP/h rates, however the only benefit of being on-task is the use of , as the effect does not work on him. Desirable Drops \u2b25 Soul Devourers are one of the sources that drop the Key to the Crossing and Vital Sparks , adding a lot of value to each task. Keys are dropped at a rate of 1/75 on task, which can be increased to 1/60 with the usage of Sophanem Slayer dungeon drop enhancers. Vital sparks are uncommon drops, and can be doubled via the use of Vital Spark enhancers, which can be purchased with dungeoneering tokens alongside the key enhancers. \u2b25 In addition to this, Soul Devourers each have their own droptables, containing good alchables and other resources, making them consistent GP, which is auto-looted in the Sophanem dungeon.

The easiest way to get there would be a Sophanem Dungeon Teleport tablet, craftable after reaching T4 reputation in the any Menaphos district. If the player has completed the Contact!, Jack of Trades and Icthlarin's Little Helper quests, a quick way to access them would be via the Menaphos lodestone, taking the bridge to Sophanem, and then running south to the dungeon entrance. Useful Items \u2b25 Feathers of Ma'at - required to kill all the mobs in the Sophanem Slayer dungeon, bar the Magister. \u2b25 Sophanem Slayer Dungeon Drop Enhancers / Vital Spark Enhancers - Purchaseable with dungeoneering tokens for 10,000 and 1000 dungeoneering tokens respectively, these offer increased drops in the dungeon.

The aim is to always be under an ult, unless making use of bleed abilities with a Masterwork Spear . Solak has a low damage potential and plentiful opportunities to heal, allowing him to be effectively killed with minimal food. Detailed below are the meta rotations for both base and DPS roles for Duo Solak, with the aim of kill-times around ~5:45 . The rotations for P1, P2, and P4 work for 4-man Solak, with P3 working for players not entering the mind realm to kill Erethdor. General Notes \u2b25 The guide contains rotations for both Bomb and Root skips, the timings of which can be found in #solak-mechanics . \u2b25 As the beginning of the fight makes use of majority melee abilities, the use of at the adren crystal in PVM hub is highly recommended, to increase damage. \u2b25 In P1, for Bomb skips , it is advised that the DPS pre-places their dominion mines on the SW roots, and the Base on the next SW root above that. \u2b25 For Root skips , it is advised that the DPS pre-places their dominion mines on the SE roots, and the Base on the NW roots.

The rotations for P1, P2, and P4 work for 4-man Solak, with P3 working for players not entering the mind realm to kill Erethdor. General Notes \u2b25 The guide contains rotations for both Bomb and Root skips, the timings of which can be found in #solak-mechanics . \u2b25 As the beginning of the fight makes use of majority melee abilities, the use of at the adren crystal in PVM hub is highly recommended, to increase damage. \u2b25 In P1, for Bomb skips , it is advised that the DPS pre-places their dominion mines on the SW roots, and the Base on the next SW root above that. \u2b25 For Root skips , it is advised that the DPS pre-places their dominion mines on the SE roots, and the Base on the NW roots.","title":"Solak Mage-Melee Hybrid (Courtesy of #LiesAndTears)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-magic-brid/#presets","text":"General \u2b25 It is assumed that the Spirit Weed , Kwuarm , and Lantadyme incense sticks are used, and an Overload and Weapon Poison +++ is drank at the bank, to save an inventory space. \u2b25 These presets are completely filled, requiring the player to drop a Spiritual at the start of the fight to pick up later when the spot is free, after Dominion mines are placed or another is drank.

The player is tasked with freeing Solak from Erethdor's grasp, aided by his sister, Merethiel, who provides aid during the fight. Solak is a high-level boss, boasting a variety of dangerous mechanics, and can be found in The Lost Grove. The encounter scales according to the number of players, ranging from 2-7 man. The mechanics and life point thresholds change across team size, which is detailed in a table below, with the loot droprates remaining constant. The boss is recommended to be fought in team sizes of 2-4, where the boss can be easily co-ordinated to avoid any issues. However, team sizes above 4 are also viable, just requiring more co-ordination and differing strategies. This channel is intended to be the overall guide to the Solak bossfight, listed below are the complete overview of each mechanic, the recommended methods of dealing with them, advanced mechanics for players more comfortable with the fight, a guide to hybriding, realming, and benchmarks for the bossfight. The #solak-range , #solak-range-brid and #solak-magic-brid channels contain optimal rotations for those strategies. General Overview Solak is a mechanically heavy boss, broken up over the 4 phases, with various targets. Some of these mechanics are optional, such as killing Erethdor. The boss makes use of the Extra Action Button multiple times during the fight, make sure to make it accessible in a suitable area of your screen. Solak attacks the main target (Base) with Melee auto-attacks, and secondary targets (DPS) with Ranged auto-attacks. Solak's melee autos cannot splash on the base, however ranged attacks are affected by the player's defence. \u2b25 These autos have travel time, so splashes can be seen pre-emptively via the shield icon on the player. \u2b25 Solak has a 5-tick auto-attack speed, which speeds up to 4-tick at certain parts of the fight. The Solak boss fight has many stationary targets, such as Volatile Rootlings and Anima Eruptions. All stationary targets in this fight face south by default, and can therefore be flanked from the north . Movable targets must be positioned correctly relative to the target as per usual. Over the fight, players can receive Blight Stacks from various mechanics, these increase the player's damage taken by 1% per stack, and can be cleansed via Merethiel in phases 2 and 3. The use of Storm Shards is heavily recommended throughout the fight, as the Shatter on P4 is vital to the success of the kill. Typical times to shard are as follows: \u2b25 P1 after HP cap \u2b25 P2 during Eruptions \u2b25 P2 after HP cap \u2b25 P4 during invulnerability Drops Solak drop values Solak can be a lucrative boss, dropping valuable uniques, such as: \u2b25 Erethdor's Blightbound Crossbow - 1/400 \u2b25 Erethdor's Off-hand Blightbound Crossbow - 1/400 \u2b25 Erethdor's Grimoire - 1/200 \u2b25 Torn Grimoire Page - 1/4 (50% chance to receive 2) These droprates are consistent across all teamsizes Each Solak kill is worth 11,731,864, with 3,841,319 of that being from commons. Advanced players can get up to 9 KPH in Duos, leading to a revenue of 105,586,777. Fight Information Scaling HP chart Auras Players have 100% hit chance on Solak using the recommended gear, so accuracy auras are useless. \u2b25 For hybriding: > (If Ranging) > \u2b25 For camping one style: / / are always the strongest auras Dominion Mines Dominion mines are particularly useful for dealing damage to the Roots, dealing 10k damage per mine. These can be pre-placed before starting the fight, and then again after the cooldown has ended. In Duo, two mines can kill a root alone, but they must be placed on the same tick in order to kill a target. The images below shows the location of the 8 Root spawns and the locations that players should pre-place mines. Duo 4-Man The orange squares represent pre-placed mines, the red squares represent the next set of mines placed during the kill. Phase 1 Solak Attack Rotation 2 Autos \u2192 Green Pads \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Bombs Explode & Roots Spawn \u2192 13 Autos \u2192 Root Arrows \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Blight Bomb 1 \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Blight Bomb 2 \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Arms and Legs \u2192 Core \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Green Pads + repeat from there Phase 1 Notes \u2b25 The rotation will restart from green pads until core is dead. \u2b25 When Solak reaches his hp cap for the phase, he will phase into Arms instead of his next special attack \u2b25 After the Blight Bomb 1, Solak increases his attack speed from 5 ticks to 4 ticks, for 10 auto-attacks. Green Pads 2 auto-attacks into P1, Solak will throw toxic spores into the air and Green Pads will spawn scattered around the arena. These can spawn in any location, even on top of each other, and occupy 3x3 squares. 1 pad is spawned for each player in the instance, and must be stood on by a player within 6s (10t) seconds of their spawn. For every pad that is missed, the players are dealt ~7k+ damage, and 5 blight stacks are applied to the player. It is recommended that the player uses Bladed Dive to move to these pads. Once absorbed, they reset , allowing you to quickly move back to where you were. \u2b25 For advanced players, this can be done in 1 tick, and abilities can be stalled for release on Solak. An example clip can be seen below in the advanced section. Blight Bombs 2 individual Blight Bombs (Bomb 1 and Bomb 2) are spawned in P1, with a third as part of the Pads mechanic. The timings for these bombs are set in the attack rotation above. These are indicated by a green bar above the player's head, and take 10 seconds to charge, after which they explode for ~7k+ damage. \u2b25 Bombs 1 and 2 are AoE, in a 3x3 area, and deal reduced damage based on the player's proximity to their team-mates. \u2b25 There are a few ways to deal with the bomb from the green pads \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using disruption shield is the most optimal way as it is lossless. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Resonance : This will fully negate the bomb\u2019s damage at the cost of a GCD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Debilitate / Reflect . This is not recommended at all, but is a safe method. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tank it. You will take maximum ~8k damage with a zerk aura. A Vitality powerburst may be helpful here. Note: The melee hit will land 1 tick before the bomb damage, so use Resonance / Disruption Shield as you see the melee hit. Depending on how far away you are from Solak, the bomb will hit before the range attack. Volatile Rootlings and Blightbound Lashers After the Green pads mechanic ends, 26 seconds into the fight, Solak spawns 8 Volatile Rootlings, with differing HP depending on team size. These are important to deal with, as if left unchecked for 1 minute, they will begin to transform into Blightbound Lashers. These Lashers deal highly accurate, highly damaging ranged hits, and as they spawn, turn other roots into lashers and heal other spawns up to a maximum of 660,000 HP. Multiple spawns must be avoided at all costs, as they are almost guaranteed to kill you. \u2b25 If 1 lasher is left alive, it can be ignored whilst dealing with other mechanics, and killed during downtime. \u2b25 Solak will also spawn 2 Blightbound Lashers, with 50,000 HP, if the player fails to kill both of his arms or legs. Root Arrows 13 auto-attacks after the Volatile Rootlings spawn, arrows will spawn on the map for players on the team, with varying timers based on ordering, indicated with an arrow and a chat message \"Roots are preparing to rush you from the edge of the arena! Look out! [#] (seconds)\". These arrows indicate the spawn location of the centre of 3 Root lines, which converge on the marked player. If caught in this attack, it deals ~2,000 damage per tick, and stuns the player, and damages anybody in it's path. As such, these arrows must be dealt with to avoid killing teammates. \u2b25 The player does not have to go directly to the arrow, just ensure the direction is clear of any teammates, and then take 1 step away from the arrow as the timer hits 0. Use Anticipate or Freedom beforehand to avoid any chance of being stunned. Solak's Arms Solak punches his arms into the ground, these spawn with varying HP and must be killed in ~30 seconds to progress. Both arms can be damaged by the Dragon Breath ability, if standing on the correct spot. Solak's Legs After the arms are killed, Solak's legs become attackable, requiring less damage but must be killed faster, in ~25 seconds, to release the Blighted Core. These are 3x3 targets with 2 squares space in between them, allowing a fully charged Detonate to hit both legs, but requiring the use of a halberd or a dummy for Melee and Ranged respectively. A non-halberd weapon can be used, but requires precise positioning, blocked by Solak's hitbox. Blighted Core Solak's Core is required to be killed to progress into Phase 2, with varying HP based on teamsize, 125k HP per player in the arena. The core is attackable for exactly 29 ticks, and is a 3x3, rotating target. In order to consistently flank the core, players must step underneath it, as it rotates towards attacking players. Phase 1 Advanced Mechanics With increased DPS, many of Solak's mechanics can be avoided entirely. As such, there are many advanced mechanics and strategies to deal with these skips: Skips \u2b25 Bomb Skips - If Solak reaches his P1 HP cap within 1:31, he will phase into arms. \u2b25 Root Skips - If Solak reaches his P1 HP cap within 1:06, he will phase into arms. \u2b25 1-cycle core (1cc) - Killing Solak's Core in one rotation, skipping the repeat P1 rotation. Ability Stalling on Pads As mentioned above, due to the ability of the Pads to reset Bladed Dive , the player can use this to stall an ability as they deal with the mechanic, releasing it in their ultimate to increase damage. This is done by bladed diving whilst the GCD is active, casting an ability, then bladed diving back to your original position and clicking Solak to release it before the next ability. https://youtu.be/X8RKn_xw6Ak Chin Legs As the legs are 3 squares apart, a correctly placed MKII Invention Dummy can be used to attack both legs at the same time with Mechanical Chinchompas. Video examples of how to place the dummy correctly can be found below. https://youtu.be/4b7ZJg1WZG4 https://youtu.be/Wv3Taq-OBe8 Sunshine Spot Both of Solak's arms can be hit with the Dragon Breath ability, which requires the player to be standing on specific squares. This is shown in an image below, marked by the dirt circle directly west of the middle of the arena. When achieving the meta skips, this should be pre-placed on these squares, to deal with the arms and legs faster. Phase 2 Phase 2 Rotation Eruptions \u2192 Anima Bombs \u2192 12 Autos \u2192 Blight Rain \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Binding Crush (Arm Climb) \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight Rain \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Root Arrow \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight Bomb \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight Rain Phase 2 Notes \u2b25 Upon killing the Blighted Core, P2 starts, and all players are granted 5 blight stacks. From this point onwards, Merethiel can be interacted with to clear blight stacks, with a 25 second cooldown. \u2b25 The secondary mechanic, Corruption, is required to reach 0% to begin phase 3. Solak will phase on the next special attack when the bar hits 0%. \u2b25 The rotation will restart from anima bombs if not at 0% corruption Corruption Corruption is the over-arching mechanic of P2, displayed as a secondary bar underneath Solak's HP bar, shown below. This bar must be completely drained in order to phase into P3, and is drained by a variety of factors. \u2b25 The first factor is Solak's HP, draining HP directly drains the Corruption % \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, in Duo and Trio teamsizes, draining his HP to hit the HP cap will not lead to him phasing until a special attack, it will end on the first hit of the 2nd Blight Rain in Duo, or after the Arm Climb in Trio. He must be healed via a Calorie Bomb or damaged through the use of the ECB special attack in order to drain the bar enough, or a combination of both in Trio. The Split Soul special attack drains the corruption % directly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Corruption bar is also drained via the mechanics, each Blight Rain and Hurricane will drain the bar by 2% per hit, and successfully climbing the arm drains 20% Corruption. Anima Eruptions The beginning of P2 starts as Solak's Blighted Core dies. 4 eruptions spawn, which must be killed in order to progress into the rest of P2, as he gets capped HP until all Eruptions die. Upon killing an eruption, a blue circle appears in it's place, which teleports the player up to deal with the Blight Storm. This takes 7.2 seconds from the death of the Eruption, leaving time to cleanse your blight stacks with Merethiel and Bladed Dive or Surge into the circle. These are the only secondary target aside from Erethdor that are not affected by the effect of the Inquisitor's Staff Blight Storm \u2b25 Directly linked to the Anima Eruptions, the Blight Storm is a secondary target in P2. Across the phase, it constantly drops anima bombs, applying 1 blight stack and hitting for ~1500-2000 base damage, every 10 seconds that the storm is alive. These bombs also increase the size of the blight pool on the floor of arena, starting small in the centre and increasing in size as more bombs drop. This deals low damage and grants blight stacks, so avoid stepping in it. It is cleared with the first Blight Rain attack. \u2b25 The storm has varying HPs, and can only be directly damaged by teleporting using the blue circles spawned by Eruptions. The player deals damage to the storm based on the number of blight stacks they have, dealing 10k damage per click with 0 stacks, 0 damage at 10 blight stacks, and any stacks after 10 will cause the player to heal the storm. After teleporting up, the player can use defensive abilities and move around on the platform, but the main focus is to spam click the storm until it dies. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The recommended method of dealing with the storm involves cleansing with Merethiel as you kill the first Eruption, click her as you cast your last ability and move to her cleansing pad. Surge or Bladed Dive can be used to get back into the blue circle, and allows you to deal 10k damage per click. Doing this only requires a total of (team size + 1) people to go up to damage the storm, i,e: for Duos, the base should go up once with the DPS together, and DPS once more on their own to deal with the remaining HP, and only requires you to cleanse once at the start. Anima bombs (Minefield) After killing the Eruptions, Solak turns the arena into a minefield, with Anima Bombs appearing in random positions for 30 seconds. These damage in a 3x3 area, and are marked by a purple ball rising from the floor, before slamming back down into the ground after 5 seconds. They start off dealing ~750 damage, and increase in damage over the course of the special attack ending around ~8k+. \u2b25 The \"safest\" place to stand is directly north, between the two northernmost torches. This does not guarantee safety from the bombs, so you will have to make sure to keep an eye out. Blight Rain + Nature's Blessing As the final Anima Bombs fall, an interactable Nature's Blessing will spawn in the north of the arena. This gives 3 players a 7x7 blessing shield that can be activated via the Extra Action button. 2 auto-attacks after the blessing spawns, Solak calls a Blight Rain special, where 5 highly damaging blight hits rain down on the player. These each hit for ~8k+ damage, which is reduced to ~2k when inside the blessing, and drain the Corruption bar by 2%. \u2b25 Each hit of the rain grants 5 blight stacks, reduced to 2 when inside the blessing. \u2b25 It is recommended to use Debilitate to reduce the damage taken by the rain hits, then uses Resonance to heal up once at low HP, by stepping out of the blessing, being careful to not snipe it with Solak's auto-attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For the player intending to climb the arm, make sure to use on an earlier hit, in order for it to be off cooldown later. \u2b25 The interactable Nature's Blessing can be taken 3 times, regardless of team size, and it is recommended that one is taken by the Base and one DPSer first, then after the first Rain is finished, the Base takes the second. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows players to make use of Flanking during the mechanic, in order to speed up the phase. \u2b25 A second Blight Rain is called 4 auto-attacks after the Arm Climb special, which follows the same mechanics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you will have used 2 shields for the first Rain, the players should all stand together under the same blessing. \u2b25 A third Blight Rain is called after the second Root Arrow, after which the P2 rotation will restart. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is extremely unlikely that you will ever see this attack, however if you expect to get this, use one shield per Rain, in order to have one for this attack. Arm Climb After the first Blight Rain finishes, Solak will root a random target to the floor, and slam his arm down on their location shortly after. This will deal an instakill to any players standing on the direct square, and a ~3.5k melee hit to players in the area around it. \u2b25 Through the use of Anticipate or Freedom before the rooting, the rooted player can move away freely. If these cannot be used, another player can click at their feet to free them. If Solak misses his slam, his arm remains stuck in the floor for a player to climb upon and greatly reduce the Corruption by 20% with a cutscene-style attack, after which Solak retaliates with a hard-hitting melee attack. \u2b25 During this climb, the player can continue to attack if using Magic or Ranged, but not with Melee. \u2b25 You can use Resonance to heal or Divert to gain a large amount of adrenaline from the melee hit. Hurricane After the second Blight Rain, Solak becomes surrounded by purple swirling rings, and he spins into a hurricane which releases 5 hits in quick succession, similar to the Blight Rain. Each hit deals around ~8k+ damage, and is impossible to survive without the use of defensive abilities. \u2b25 If the player expects this attack, they should build to Barricade before the attack starts, and it will last the duration of the special attack. \u2b25 By this point, the player will have amassed a large amount of blight stacks, which can be cleansed with Merethiel to reduce damage taken. Root Arrows This attack is similar to the Root Arrows in Phase 1, two of these follow the Hurricane special attack. The player's screen shakes, Solak slams his arms into the ground, and an arrow of roots will spawn 7 squares behind the Base and converge on their location when the mechanic started, moving towards Solak. To avoid these, simply move away from where you were standing. \u2b25 A Blight Bomb occurs between the two root arrows, to up to 3 players without Solak's aggro. When the bomb explodes, the second arrow will start. Blight Bomb This is directly linked to the Root Arrows mechanic, where players without Solak's aggro will be given a blight bar above their head, the same as the bombs in P1. Phase 2 Advanced Mechanics In Duo and Trio teamsizes, Phase 2 is timegated by the Arm Climb mechanic, and the Anima Eruptions are a vital part of fast kills. As such, advanced strategies for dealing with them are detailed below: Anima Eruptions As mentioned, dealing with Anima Eruptions quickly is a determinant for fast kills. Two examples of quickly clearing eruptions are shown below. Advanced players can also choose to kill the Eruptions but avoid going up to deal with the storm, and instead tank the bombs until the fight ends. This is known as Storm-tanking, and can save ~10s per kill. This significantly increases your food consumption and is only recommended as one of the very last ways to improve time. 4-man South Eruptions - https://youtu.be/KQcYpoxf0mo Melee north Eruptions - https://youtu.be/dESMelseYF0 Natural Instinct Due to the timegated nature of P2 in duo and trio, the time can be utilised wisely to speed up P3, through the use of Natural Instinct at the end of the phase. With a well timed , players can save their for use later in P3. Two examples of the correct timing are shown below. Base - https://youtu.be/ab51E7Y3fIg DPS - https://youtu.be/EGDinCAECB0 Phase 3 Solak Attack Rotation 8 Autos \u2192 Stun \u2192 5 Autos \u2192 Blight Bomb \u2192 2 autos \u2192 Stun Phase 3 Notes As this phase starts, 8 sigils spawn on the floor around the arena, 4 in the cardinal directions and 4 in between those. Alongside these, the mind realm becomes accessible through the Extra Action button, where the players can fight Erethdor. The phase ends when either all 8 sigils are filled, or Erethdor dies, and the fight progresses on to P4. As each Blight Bomb spawns, Solak increases his attack speed to 4 ticks until the stun mechanic. Sigils (Pads) These sigils charge as Solak is stepping on them, indicated by a circular progress bar surrounding them, which takes 15s. Once charged, they turn purple, a blight bomb falls from the sky onto the sigil, and Solak is immobilised and shakes violently, unable to attack for 15 seconds. During this time, Solak cannot attack, and the Extra Action button can be used to enter the Mind Realm, where Erethdor can be fought. \u2b25 This is a good point to regenerate a lot of HP via Soulsplit and position yourself to use Flanking \u2b25 As Erethdor has quite low HP, it is recommended to end the phase by killing him instead of charging all 8 pads, as this takes significantly longer. Blight Bombs There are two types of Blight Bombs in P3 \u2b25 One type are dropped by Erethdor from the Mind Realm, which land on the sigils both randomly and when they finish charging. These deal ~2k damage per hit. Reflect or Vengeance reflects the damage directly to Erethdor, helpful to finish him off if he has very little HP remaining. \u2b25 The second bomb spawns throughout P3, tied to the Stun special attack. Up to 3 players that do not have Solak's aggro will recieve a bar above their head, the same as bombs in P1. However, when these explode, a line of roots directly connect all players with the bomb, which can stun and deal large damage to players caught within. These do not affect the players who recieve the bomb, but position yourself carefully to avoid killing teammates, away from the boss. Stun After the first 8 autos of the fight, Solak raises his arm into the air, stuns the player, and inflicts a blight bleed on every player in the fight until he is stunned back. This bleed hits every 2 ticks, and starts off with a low damaging hit of only ~200 damage, but increases by the same amount for every hit, which builds up very quickly. Following this, he will repeat this attack every 7 autos. \u2b25 Solak requires multiple stuns to stop the bleed, X-2 stuns for all teamsizes, capping at 1, where X is the number of players not in the Mind Realm when the attack begins. \u2b25 Solak only checks for stun abilities, so your stuns can be flanked and still work. \u2b25 This blight bleed starts off dealing low damage, but scales up rapidly and can even hit players who teleport to the Mind Realm, so make sure to stun immediately. It is recommended to use Anticipate or Freedom beforehand in order to avoid getting stunned by Solak, and then use stuns naturally as part of your rotation, taking into account this mechanic. These abilties are: ( / / / / / / / ) \u2b25 Standing in the very north of the arena, by the stairs, allows you to avoid being stunned, however due to the placement of the pads, this is usually not feasible. Erethdor Erethdor is the Elf controlling Solak's mind, and is a secondary mechanic for the boss fight, offered as an alternative to charging all sigils. Killing Erethdor rewards the player by reducing the damage Shadow Manifestations deal to Solak on P4, alongside significantly faster kills. This is the recommended method of ending P3 . When the sigils are charged, the Extra Action button can be used to enter the mind realm, where the player can fight Erethdor, a ranger who uses EoC abilities. When Erethdor dies, P3 ends, regardless of Solak's HP. \u2b25 Erethdor can use these abilities, in random order: / / / / / / / and uses quickly after being bled with , or . \u2b25 The player is allowed to be in the Mind Realm for ~20s, before being teleported back to Solak's arena. The animation for leaving begins around ~17s, however abilities can still be cast on Erethdor in that transition. \u2b25 Inside the Mind Realm, the player cannot heal from any direct sources, such as foods, potions, and portents. This will be covered in more detail in P4. \u2b25 Up to 2 players can enter the Mind Realm at once, regardless of teamsize. More advanced players will require less ventures into the Mind Realm in order to kill Erethdor, as in duo they will aim to kill him in 1 \"cycle\". Rotations for both melee and range Elf kills can be found in #solak-range-brid and #solak-magic-brid . Phase 4 Phase 4 Notes In this phase, Solak is solely focused on Merethiel, and is unable to attack the players. This part of the fight is kill or be killed, similar to Vorago P5, and Solak must be defeated before his mind is consumed by Erethdor's manifestations. As such, there are few mechanics outside of the over-arching mechanic, Solak's Mind. Burst of Nature During P4, Solak gains the ability to deal a large blight hit to all players in the arena, dealing upwards of ~12k damage if not dealt with. Solak takes time to charge this attack, it is released every ~28 seconds, marked by a purple hurricane surrounding him. The damage he deals with this attack can be reduced to ~3k via the use of several stuns, which are as follows: ( / / / / / / / ). These abilities should therefore be used early into the phase, as part of your DPS rotation, and flanked abilities still work to reduce the damage. Blight Bomb Exactly the same as the P1 Blight Bombs, these are given to 2 random players in the arena, with the bar beginning shortly before the Burst of Nature is fully charged. \u2b25 If a player enters the Mind Realm after receiving a blight bomb, upon detonation, they will take no damage from it. Mind Realm In the final Phase of Solak, Erethdor attempts to consume Solak's mind, through his manifestations inside of the Mind Realm. The player's job is to defeat Solak before the manifestations consume Solak. The Mind Realm can be entered in order to protect him, known as \"realming\", and completely avoiding this mechanic and killing Solak is known as \"no-realm\" and requires strong damage. \u2b25 Solak's Mind has 100k HP, regardless of teamsize. This is damaged by manifestations, their damage increases over time and will kill Solak in ~18-24 seconds from when he becomes attackable if left unchecked. The player's health can be sacrificed to heal Solak's mind, healing the equivalent damage taken, each click dealing ~2k damage to the player. This damage is blocked by Barricade , which can be used to safely heal Solak's mind. \u2b25 If Solak's mind is consumed, all players are insta-killed, bypassing the Sign of Life. \u2b25 If the player dies at the same time as Solak, Merethiel will revive them, avoiding their death mechanics. This will still clear the effects of Incense Sticks. \u2b25 Mind Realm Mechanics \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Accessed via the Extra Action button, available from the start of the phase, with a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Mind Realm blocks direct forms of healing such as eating food , drinking potions , or healing portents. Other forms of healing, such as Soulsplit , Excalibur , Phoenix Necklaces , or healing familiars can be used, and are recommended to be used to heal if available. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Up to 2 people can be in the Mind Realm at once, and unlike in P3, players can remain indefinitely. \u2b25 Manifestations \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Erethdor was killed to progress from P3, Manifestations will deal reduced damage to Solak and targeted players. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Erethdor's Manifestations continuously damage Solak's mind, when not aggro'd to a player. Upon being tagged, they shift their focus to the player, and deal weak ~1k magic hits to the player. The longer they are alive, the more damage they deal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Manifestations have 2 spawn mechanics, they spawn on a set interval timer, and also spawn as Solak takes damage, in consistent intervals depending on team size. If struggling with no-realming, delay large damage such as in order to back-load the damage and reduce spawns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These have 25,000 HP regardless of team size, and if killed in the Mind Realm, become transported to the overworld, where they begin to attack all players in the arena. Attack Timing The timing to barge Solak before he's vulnerable can be gauged, you should be barging as he flies back from Merethiel (Assuming the animation does not glitch out for you) \u2b25 Barge timing - https://youtu.be/c1wbZZQX7yI \u2b25 Pre-Barge timing - https://youtu.be/DXUujotIZKU Realming Overview When learning or in the case of missing teammates, correctly dealing with the Mind Realm is vital to securing the kill. This can be done effectively in one of two ways, entering immediately or entering late: \u2b25 When in the Mind Realm, make sure to always be praying , activate to heal when needed, and use Fortitude to reduce damage taken. Immediate Entering \u2b25 Entering immediately gives the largest amount of control over the manifestations, as you can easily tag them as they spawn and focus on defensives. This is slower than entering late, but is worthwhile depending on team DPS. \u2b25 As you won't be dealing damage to Solak or Manifestations, all of your adrenaline can be utilised for defensives. \u2b25 Start with Immortality , for the 25% damage reduction for 30s. If the manifestations do not proc immortality before it ends, heal Solak until it procs, to make the most out of it. Whilst building adren, use Reflect and Devotion at low HP to reduce more damage, building for Barricade as the final defensive. Once barricaded, spam click Solak to heal him, whilst tagging new spawns to take their aggro. Entering Late \u2b25 This method is employed if you feel team DPS is lacking, and is a high-risk high-reward strategy. This involves dealing large amounts of damage early into the phase, then entering the Mind Realm to tag manifestations whilst your team finishes the rest of the fight. \u2b25 After dumping thresholds outside, enter the realm and immediately tag every Manifestation available, focusing old before new, making use of Chain and auto-attacks with defensives. Make sure to pray , use Reflect until low HP, then Devo and Barricade as it runs out. As before, spam heal Solak when caded, whilst tagging new manifestations. \u2b25 For Hybrid - \u2192 Build until attackable \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Enter \u2b25 For Mage - Pre- \u2192 before attackable \u2192 + / \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Enter Examples The rotations aren't set in stone, and are entirely dependent on the team DPS. Some teams may find their damage is higher, as such less thresholds must be used in the late method, and Reflect can be skipped in favour of Devo \u2192 Cade \u2b25 Immediate realming - https://youtu.be/HeOJVdY5Ibk \u2b25 Late realming - https://youtu.be/NicaCm-FxAo Introduction to Hybrid Solak is a boss with low defence and low damage output, allowing for the use of hybrid strategies in order to maintain as much uptime in ultimate abilities as possible, greatly increasing the player's damage output. However, starting off with hybrid can be unfamiliar, and is taxing on inventory space, since it greatly reduces the amount of food you can take. It is recommended to be comfortable with both Solak as a boss and with multiple combat styles before learning to hybrid. Hybriding assumes the player starts from a mage or range setup, adding in melee gear in order to make use of Berserk , the ZGS special attack, and the effect of the MW Spear of Annihilation . As such, the most important switches to add are listed below, in order of priority: Mage Hybrid \u2b25 Base Magic setup (DW+2h, Flank, Planted Feet) \u2b25 Melee Legs+Body + Melee DW \u2b25 Melee 2h \u2b25 Masterwork Spear \u2b25 Melee Flanking \u2b25 Melee Helmet \u2b25 EoF Gstaff \u2b25 Melee Boots \u2b25 Borrowed Power Smoke Cloud ( ) The presets below give a rough idea of how presets adapt from a base Magic setup, to a learner Hybrid setup, to an advanced Hybrid Setup. Some items are more or less useful depending on the role, Base vs DPS: Mage Camp Learner Brid Full Mage Brid Range Hybrid \u2b25 Base Ranged setup (DW+2h, Flank, Planted Feet, EoF Dbow) \u2b25 Melee Legs+Body + Melee DW \u2b25 Melee 2h \u2b25 Masterwork Spear \u2b25 Melee Flanking \u2b25 Melee Helmet \u2b25 EoF ECB \u2b25 EoF SGB \u2b25 Melee Boots \u2b25 Borrowed Power Smoke Cloud ( ) The presets below give a rough idea of how presets adapt from a base Ranged setup, to a learner Hybrid setup, to an advanced Hybrid Setup. Some items are more or less useful depending on the role, Base vs DPS: Range Camp Learner Brid Full Range Brid Explanation These switches typically replace food, however as you bring more switches for the hybrid setup, you will have to employ more advanced strategies, such as pre-potting at the bank for inventory spaces. Hybriding isn't just about bringing gear with you, making effective use out of the gear requires well-thought out strategies and optimal ultimate usage to increase damage output. To start off, this can be quite overwhelming, so the strategies below list how to make the most use out of your hybrid setup. Mage Hybrid Start out with the 2 most important Zerks, which are on Solak's Core and P4. These are low risk, as you are not being damaged so you can enjoy the full damage increase without any worry. After this, the next zerks to work into your rotation are listed below, in order of priority: \u2b25 Zerk Core + P4 \u2b25 Zerk Erethdor (If going in solo) \u2b25 Zerk P3 start \u2b25 ZGS Erethdor (If going in duo) \u2b25 Zerk+ZGS Start \u2b25 Zerk P2 start Once you get more comfortable, making more use of the ZGS special attack such as in P1 and on Erethdor is recommended. However, when starting out in larger teams, or for lower DPS teams, using Berserk on Erethdor to start off may find more success, until better strategies are learned. Ranged Hybrid Due to the effectiveness of the ECB special attack, the ZGS special attack sees no use in Range Hybrid. However, the damage from Berserk and the effect of the MW Spear of Annihilation are highly useful for damage output. The next zerks to work into your rotation are listed below, in order of priority: \u2b25 Zerk Core + P4 \u2b25 Zerk Erethdor (If going in solo) \u2b25 Zerk P3 start \u2b25 Zerk Start \u2b25 Zerk P2 start Ranged Hybrid is quite different to Mage Hybrid, as the ECB special attack is so strong. As such, only critical zerks are recommended, and unless the player finds their team DPS lacking, ECB is recommended to use on Erethdor Benchmarks What Times Mean Learning a boss requires practice and time, and learning happens at different speeds for everyone. As such, listed below are the benchmarks of killspeeds with certain skips taken into account, and how to transition between them. \u2b25 12+ mins - 3 or 2 cycle core (3/2cc), Hurricane P2, Charging pads P3, Realming P4 \u2b25 10+ mins - 2 cycle core (2cc), 2nd Rain P2, 2 cycle Erethdor, Realming P4 \u2b25 8+ mins - 2 or 1cc (with Bomb skips), 2nd Rain P2, Erethdor, No Realm \u2b25 6+ mins - 1cc (with Root skips), Arm Climb, 1-cycle Erethdor, No realm Improving with your Kill Times Starting off, players are expected to take the boss slowly, and focus more on mechanics. As they become more comfortable, then they can focus more on damage, and obtaining faster kills. \u2b25 12-10 mins - At this point, players are expecting to take it slowly. To improve from here, spend less time dealing with Roots and other mechanics on P1, and aim to make good use of the flank shield for the first Rain attack. Aim to reach the P2 HP cap by the 2nd Rain attack in order to avoid having to use Barricade to deal with the Hurricane. Transition from charging all pads p3 to dealing with erethdor, as this saves easily 2 minutes if the phase can be done in 4 pads. At this point, becoming more comfortable with mechanics is the main focus. \u2b25 10-8 mins - Here you will be working on refining your kills from the 10 min range, getting consistency in your 1 cycle cores, and implementing advanced skips like Bomb skips in P1. After this, phasing solak in P2 consistently with the first hit of the second rain attack, killing Erethdor in 2 cycles and making efficient use of pads. Starting P3 without cleansing is expected by this point. With the use of Berserk or Death's Swiftness and strong damage, No Realm kills are expected to be implemented here, saving 10-15+ seconds. \u2b25 8-6 mins - Here you will be working on consistent 1 cycle cores with advanced skips, Bomb or Root skips. Aim to end P2 with the Arm Climb attack, killing Erethdor in 1 cycle, and consistent, quick No Realm kills. \u2b25 6 mins - At this point, speeding up is a matter of consistency, reaching the timegates of each phase. Fast P1s end around ~1:50, Storm tanking can be used to save ~10s per kill, P2 is timegated to the Arm Climb attack. Aim to finish P3 in 2 pads which are charged immediately, and P4 is a quick No Realm kill.","title":"Solak mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#solak-mechanics","text":"Solak Mechanics (Courtesy of #LiesAndTears & #Malevolence) Introduction Solak is an anima guardian, enslaved by the dark elf Erethdor to siphon energy from the Lost Grove. The player is tasked with freeing Solak from Erethdor's grasp, aided by his sister, Merethiel, who provides aid during the fight. Solak is a high-level boss, boasting a variety of dangerous mechanics, and can be found in The Lost Grove. The encounter scales according to the number of players, ranging from 2-7 man. The mechanics and life point thresholds change across team size, which is detailed in a table below, with the loot droprates remaining constant. The boss is recommended to be fought in team sizes of 2-4, where the boss can be easily co-ordinated to avoid any issues. However, team sizes above 4 are also viable, just requiring more co-ordination and differing strategies. This channel is intended to be the overall guide to the Solak bossfight, listed below are the complete overview of each mechanic, the recommended methods of dealing with them, advanced mechanics for players more comfortable with the fight, a guide to hybriding, realming, and benchmarks for the bossfight. The #solak-range , #solak-range-brid and #solak-magic-brid channels contain optimal rotations for those strategies. General Overview Solak is a mechanically heavy boss, broken up over the 4 phases, with various targets. Some of these mechanics are optional, such as killing Erethdor. The boss makes use of the Extra Action Button multiple times during the fight, make sure to make it accessible in a suitable area of your screen. Solak attacks the main target (Base) with Melee auto-attacks, and secondary targets (DPS) with Ranged auto-attacks. Solak's melee autos cannot splash on the base, however ranged attacks are affected by the player's defence. \u2b25 These autos have travel time, so splashes can be seen pre-emptively via the shield icon on the player. \u2b25 Solak has a 5-tick auto-attack speed, which speeds up to 4-tick at certain parts of the fight. The Solak boss fight has many stationary targets, such as Volatile Rootlings and Anima Eruptions. All stationary targets in this fight face south by default, and can therefore be flanked from the north . Movable targets must be positioned correctly relative to the target as per usual. Over the fight, players can receive Blight Stacks from various mechanics, these increase the player's damage taken by 1% per stack, and can be cleansed via Merethiel in phases 2 and 3. The use of Storm Shards is heavily recommended throughout the fight, as the Shatter on P4 is vital to the success of the kill. Typical times to shard are as follows: \u2b25 P1 after HP cap \u2b25 P2 during Eruptions \u2b25 P2 after HP cap \u2b25 P4 during invulnerability","title":"Solak mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#drops","text":"Solak drop values Solak can be a lucrative boss, dropping valuable uniques, such as: \u2b25 Erethdor's Blightbound Crossbow - 1/400 \u2b25 Erethdor's Off-hand Blightbound Crossbow - 1/400 \u2b25 Erethdor's Grimoire - 1/200 \u2b25 Torn Grimoire Page - 1/4 (50% chance to receive 2) These droprates are consistent across all teamsizes Each Solak kill is worth 11,731,864, with 3,841,319 of that being from commons.

Green Pads 2 auto-attacks into P1, Solak will throw toxic spores into the air and Green Pads will spawn scattered around the arena. These can spawn in any location, even on top of each other, and occupy 3x3 squares. 1 pad is spawned for each player in the instance, and must be stood on by a player within 6s (10t) seconds of their spawn. For every pad that is missed, the players are dealt ~7k+ damage, and 5 blight stacks are applied to the player. It is recommended that the player uses Bladed Dive to move to these pads. Once absorbed, they reset , allowing you to quickly move back to where you were. \u2b25 For advanced players, this can be done in 1 tick, and abilities can be stalled for release on Solak. An example clip can be seen below in the advanced section. Blight Bombs 2 individual Blight Bombs (Bomb 1 and Bomb 2) are spawned in P1, with a third as part of the Pads mechanic. The timings for these bombs are set in the attack rotation above. These are indicated by a green bar above the player's head, and take 10 seconds to charge, after which they explode for ~7k+ damage. \u2b25 Bombs 1 and 2 are AoE, in a 3x3 area, and deal reduced damage based on the player's proximity to their team-mates. \u2b25 There are a few ways to deal with the bomb from the green pads \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using disruption shield is the most optimal way as it is lossless. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Resonance : This will fully negate the bomb\u2019s damage at the cost of a GCD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Debilitate / Reflect . This is not recommended at all, but is a safe method. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tank it. You will take maximum ~8k damage with a zerk aura. A Vitality powerburst may be helpful here. Note: The melee hit will land 1 tick before the bomb damage, so use Resonance / Disruption Shield as you see the melee hit. Depending on how far away you are from Solak, the bomb will hit before the range attack. Volatile Rootlings and Blightbound Lashers After the Green pads mechanic ends, 26 seconds into the fight, Solak spawns 8 Volatile Rootlings, with differing HP depending on team size. These are important to deal with, as if left unchecked for 1 minute, they will begin to transform into Blightbound Lashers. These Lashers deal highly accurate, highly damaging ranged hits, and as they spawn, turn other roots into lashers and heal other spawns up to a maximum of 660,000 HP. Multiple spawns must be avoided at all costs, as they are almost guaranteed to kill you. \u2b25 If 1 lasher is left alive, it can be ignored whilst dealing with other mechanics, and killed during downtime. \u2b25 Solak will also spawn 2 Blightbound Lashers, with 50,000 HP, if the player fails to kill both of his arms or legs. Root Arrows 13 auto-attacks after the Volatile Rootlings spawn, arrows will spawn on the map for players on the team, with varying timers based on ordering, indicated with an arrow and a chat message \"Roots are preparing to rush you from the edge of the arena! Look out! [#] (seconds)\". These arrows indicate the spawn location of the centre of 3 Root lines, which converge on the marked player. If caught in this attack, it deals ~2,000 damage per tick, and stuns the player, and damages anybody in it's path. As such, these arrows must be dealt with to avoid killing teammates. \u2b25 The player does not have to go directly to the arrow, just ensure the direction is clear of any teammates, and then take 1 step away from the arrow as the timer hits 0. Use Anticipate or Freedom beforehand to avoid any chance of being stunned. Solak's Arms Solak punches his arms into the ground, these spawn with varying HP and must be killed in ~30 seconds to progress. Both arms can be damaged by the Dragon Breath ability, if standing on the correct spot. Solak's Legs After the arms are killed, Solak's legs become attackable, requiring less damage but must be killed faster, in ~25 seconds, to release the Blighted Core. These are 3x3 targets with 2 squares space in between them, allowing a fully charged Detonate to hit both legs, but requiring the use of a halberd or a dummy for Melee and Ranged respectively. A non-halberd weapon can be used, but requires precise positioning, blocked by Solak's hitbox. Blighted Core Solak's Core is required to be killed to progress into Phase 2, with varying HP based on teamsize, 125k HP per player in the arena. The core is attackable for exactly 29 ticks, and is a 3x3, rotating target. In order to consistently flank the core, players must step underneath it, as it rotates towards attacking players.","title":"Phase 1"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#phase-1-advanced-mechanics","text":"With increased DPS, many of Solak's mechanics can be avoided entirely. As such, there are many advanced mechanics and strategies to deal with these skips: Skips \u2b25 Bomb Skips - If Solak reaches his P1 HP cap within 1:31, he will phase into arms. \u2b25 Root Skips - If Solak reaches his P1 HP cap within 1:06, he will phase into arms. \u2b25 1-cycle core (1cc) - Killing Solak's Core in one rotation, skipping the repeat P1 rotation. Ability Stalling on Pads As mentioned above, due to the ability of the Pads to reset Bladed Dive , the player can use this to stall an ability as they deal with the mechanic, releasing it in their ultimate to increase damage. This is done by bladed diving whilst the GCD is active, casting an ability, then bladed diving back to your original position and clicking Solak to release it before the next ability. https://youtu.be/X8RKn_xw6Ak Chin Legs As the legs are 3 squares apart, a correctly placed MKII Invention Dummy can be used to attack both legs at the same time with Mechanical Chinchompas. Video examples of how to place the dummy correctly can be found below. https://youtu.be/4b7ZJg1WZG4 https://youtu.be/Wv3Taq-OBe8 Sunshine Spot Both of Solak's arms can be hit with the Dragon Breath ability, which requires the player to be standing on specific squares. This is shown in an image below, marked by the dirt circle directly west of the middle of the arena. When achieving the meta skips, this should be pre-placed on these squares, to deal with the arms and legs faster.","title":"Phase 1 Advanced Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#phase-2","text":"Phase 2 Rotation Eruptions \u2192 Anima Bombs \u2192 12 Autos \u2192 Blight Rain \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Binding Crush (Arm Climb) \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight Rain \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Root Arrow \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight Bomb \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight Rain Phase 2 Notes \u2b25 Upon killing the Blighted Core, P2 starts, and all players are granted 5 blight stacks. From this point onwards, Merethiel can be interacted with to clear blight stacks, with a 25 second cooldown. \u2b25 The secondary mechanic, Corruption, is required to reach 0% to begin phase 3. Solak will phase on the next special attack when the bar hits 0%. \u2b25 The rotation will restart from anima bombs if not at 0% corruption Corruption Corruption is the over-arching mechanic of P2, displayed as a secondary bar underneath Solak's HP bar, shown below. This bar must be completely drained in order to phase into P3, and is drained by a variety of factors. \u2b25 The first factor is Solak's HP, draining HP directly drains the Corruption % \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, in Duo and Trio teamsizes, draining his HP to hit the HP cap will not lead to him phasing until a special attack, it will end on the first hit of the 2nd Blight Rain in Duo, or after the Arm Climb in Trio. He must be healed via a Calorie Bomb or damaged through the use of the ECB special attack in order to drain the bar enough, or a combination of both in Trio. The Split Soul special attack drains the corruption % directly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Corruption bar is also drained via the mechanics, each Blight Rain and Hurricane will drain the bar by 2% per hit, and successfully climbing the arm drains 20% Corruption. Anima Eruptions The beginning of P2 starts as Solak's Blighted Core dies. 4 eruptions spawn, which must be killed in order to progress into the rest of P2, as he gets capped HP until all Eruptions die. Upon killing an eruption, a blue circle appears in it's place, which teleports the player up to deal with the Blight Storm. This takes 7.2 seconds from the death of the Eruption, leaving time to cleanse your blight stacks with Merethiel and Bladed Dive or Surge into the circle. These are the only secondary target aside from Erethdor that are not affected by the effect of the Inquisitor's Staff Blight Storm \u2b25 Directly linked to the Anima Eruptions, the Blight Storm is a secondary target in P2. Across the phase, it constantly drops anima bombs, applying 1 blight stack and hitting for ~1500-2000 base damage, every 10 seconds that the storm is alive. These bombs also increase the size of the blight pool on the floor of arena, starting small in the centre and increasing in size as more bombs drop. This deals low damage and grants blight stacks, so avoid stepping in it. It is cleared with the first Blight Rain attack. \u2b25 The storm has varying HPs, and can only be directly damaged by teleporting using the blue circles spawned by Eruptions. The player deals damage to the storm based on the number of blight stacks they have, dealing 10k damage per click with 0 stacks, 0 damage at 10 blight stacks, and any stacks after 10 will cause the player to heal the storm. After teleporting up, the player can use defensive abilities and move around on the platform, but the main focus is to spam click the storm until it dies. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The recommended method of dealing with the storm involves cleansing with Merethiel as you kill the first Eruption, click her as you cast your last ability and move to her cleansing pad. Surge or Bladed Dive can be used to get back into the blue circle, and allows you to deal 10k damage per click. Doing this only requires a total of (team size + 1) people to go up to damage the storm, i,e: for Duos, the base should go up once with the DPS together, and DPS once more on their own to deal with the remaining HP, and only requires you to cleanse once at the start. Anima bombs (Minefield) After killing the Eruptions, Solak turns the arena into a minefield, with Anima Bombs appearing in random positions for 30 seconds. These damage in a 3x3 area, and are marked by a purple ball rising from the floor, before slamming back down into the ground after 5 seconds. They start off dealing ~750 damage, and increase in damage over the course of the special attack ending around ~8k+. \u2b25 The \"safest\" place to stand is directly north, between the two northernmost torches. This does not guarantee safety from the bombs, so you will have to make sure to keep an eye out. Blight Rain + Nature's Blessing As the final Anima Bombs fall, an interactable Nature's Blessing will spawn in the north of the arena. This gives 3 players a 7x7 blessing shield that can be activated via the Extra Action button. 2 auto-attacks after the blessing spawns, Solak calls a Blight Rain special, where 5 highly damaging blight hits rain down on the player. These each hit for ~8k+ damage, which is reduced to ~2k when inside the blessing, and drain the Corruption bar by 2%. \u2b25 Each hit of the rain grants 5 blight stacks, reduced to 2 when inside the blessing. \u2b25 It is recommended to use Debilitate to reduce the damage taken by the rain hits, then uses Resonance to heal up once at low HP, by stepping out of the blessing, being careful to not snipe it with Solak's auto-attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For the player intending to climb the arm, make sure to use on an earlier hit, in order for it to be off cooldown later. \u2b25 The interactable Nature's Blessing can be taken 3 times, regardless of team size, and it is recommended that one is taken by the Base and one DPSer first, then after the first Rain is finished, the Base takes the second. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows players to make use of Flanking during the mechanic, in order to speed up the phase. \u2b25 A second Blight Rain is called 4 auto-attacks after the Arm Climb special, which follows the same mechanics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As you will have used 2 shields for the first Rain, the players should all stand together under the same blessing. \u2b25 A third Blight Rain is called after the second Root Arrow, after which the P2 rotation will restart. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is extremely unlikely that you will ever see this attack, however if you expect to get this, use one shield per Rain, in order to have one for this attack. Arm Climb After the first Blight Rain finishes, Solak will root a random target to the floor, and slam his arm down on their location shortly after. This will deal an instakill to any players standing on the direct square, and a ~3.5k melee hit to players in the area around it. \u2b25 Through the use of Anticipate or Freedom before the rooting, the rooted player can move away freely. If these cannot be used, another player can click at their feet to free them. If Solak misses his slam, his arm remains stuck in the floor for a player to climb upon and greatly reduce the Corruption by 20% with a cutscene-style attack, after which Solak retaliates with a hard-hitting melee attack. \u2b25 During this climb, the player can continue to attack if using Magic or Ranged, but not with Melee. \u2b25 You can use Resonance to heal or Divert to gain a large amount of adrenaline from the melee hit. Hurricane After the second Blight Rain, Solak becomes surrounded by purple swirling rings, and he spins into a hurricane which releases 5 hits in quick succession, similar to the Blight Rain. Each hit deals around ~8k+ damage, and is impossible to survive without the use of defensive abilities. \u2b25 If the player expects this attack, they should build to Barricade before the attack starts, and it will last the duration of the special attack. \u2b25 By this point, the player will have amassed a large amount of blight stacks, which can be cleansed with Merethiel to reduce damage taken. Root Arrows This attack is similar to the Root Arrows in Phase 1, two of these follow the Hurricane special attack. The player's screen shakes, Solak slams his arms into the ground, and an arrow of roots will spawn 7 squares behind the Base and converge on their location when the mechanic started, moving towards Solak. To avoid these, simply move away from where you were standing. \u2b25 A Blight Bomb occurs between the two root arrows, to up to 3 players without Solak's aggro. When the bomb explodes, the second arrow will start. Blight Bomb This is directly linked to the Root Arrows mechanic, where players without Solak's aggro will be given a blight bar above their head, the same as the bombs in P1.","title":"Phase 2"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#phase-2-advanced-mechanics","text":"In Duo and Trio teamsizes, Phase 2 is timegated by the Arm Climb mechanic, and the Anima Eruptions are a vital part of fast kills. As such, advanced strategies for dealing with them are detailed below: Anima Eruptions As mentioned, dealing with Anima Eruptions quickly is a determinant for fast kills. Two examples of quickly clearing eruptions are shown below. Advanced players can also choose to kill the Eruptions but avoid going up to deal with the storm, and instead tank the bombs until the fight ends. This is known as Storm-tanking, and can save ~10s per kill. This significantly increases your food consumption and is only recommended as one of the very last ways to improve time. 4-man South Eruptions - https://youtu.be/KQcYpoxf0mo Melee north Eruptions - https://youtu.be/dESMelseYF0 Natural Instinct Due to the timegated nature of P2 in duo and trio, the time can be utilised wisely to speed up P3, through the use of Natural Instinct at the end of the phase.

Alongside these, the mind realm becomes accessible through the Extra Action button, where the players can fight Erethdor. The phase ends when either all 8 sigils are filled, or Erethdor dies, and the fight progresses on to P4. As each Blight Bomb spawns, Solak increases his attack speed to 4 ticks until the stun mechanic. Sigils (Pads) These sigils charge as Solak is stepping on them, indicated by a circular progress bar surrounding them, which takes 15s. Once charged, they turn purple, a blight bomb falls from the sky onto the sigil, and Solak is immobilised and shakes violently, unable to attack for 15 seconds. During this time, Solak cannot attack, and the Extra Action button can be used to enter the Mind Realm, where Erethdor can be fought. \u2b25 This is a good point to regenerate a lot of HP via Soulsplit and position yourself to use Flanking \u2b25 As Erethdor has quite low HP, it is recommended to end the phase by killing him instead of charging all 8 pads, as this takes significantly longer. Blight Bombs There are two types of Blight Bombs in P3 \u2b25 One type are dropped by Erethdor from the Mind Realm, which land on the sigils both randomly and when they finish charging. These deal ~2k damage per hit. Reflect or Vengeance reflects the damage directly to Erethdor, helpful to finish him off if he has very little HP remaining. \u2b25 The second bomb spawns throughout P3, tied to the Stun special attack. Up to 3 players that do not have Solak's aggro will recieve a bar above their head, the same as bombs in P1. However, when these explode, a line of roots directly connect all players with the bomb, which can stun and deal large damage to players caught within. These do not affect the players who recieve the bomb, but position yourself carefully to avoid killing teammates, away from the boss. Stun After the first 8 autos of the fight, Solak raises his arm into the air, stuns the player, and inflicts a blight bleed on every player in the fight until he is stunned back. This bleed hits every 2 ticks, and starts off with a low damaging hit of only ~200 damage, but increases by the same amount for every hit, which builds up very quickly. Following this, he will repeat this attack every 7 autos. \u2b25 Solak requires multiple stuns to stop the bleed, X-2 stuns for all teamsizes, capping at 1, where X is the number of players not in the Mind Realm when the attack begins. \u2b25 Solak only checks for stun abilities, so your stuns can be flanked and still work. \u2b25 This blight bleed starts off dealing low damage, but scales up rapidly and can even hit players who teleport to the Mind Realm, so make sure to stun immediately. It is recommended to use Anticipate or Freedom beforehand in order to avoid getting stunned by Solak, and then use stuns naturally as part of your rotation, taking into account this mechanic. These abilties are: ( / / / / / / / ) \u2b25 Standing in the very north of the arena, by the stairs, allows you to avoid being stunned, however due to the placement of the pads, this is usually not feasible. Erethdor Erethdor is the Elf controlling Solak's mind, and is a secondary mechanic for the boss fight, offered as an alternative to charging all sigils. Killing Erethdor rewards the player by reducing the damage Shadow Manifestations deal to Solak on P4, alongside significantly faster kills. This is the recommended method of ending P3 . When the sigils are charged, the Extra Action button can be used to enter the mind realm, where the player can fight Erethdor, a ranger who uses EoC abilities. When Erethdor dies, P3 ends, regardless of Solak's HP. \u2b25 Erethdor can use these abilities, in random order: / / / / / / / and uses quickly after being bled with , or . \u2b25 The player is allowed to be in the Mind Realm for ~20s, before being teleported back to Solak's arena. The animation for leaving begins around ~17s, however abilities can still be cast on Erethdor in that transition. \u2b25 Inside the Mind Realm, the player cannot heal from any direct sources, such as foods, potions, and portents. This will be covered in more detail in P4. \u2b25 Up to 2 players can enter the Mind Realm at once, regardless of teamsize. More advanced players will require less ventures into the Mind Realm in order to kill Erethdor, as in duo they will aim to kill him in 1 \"cycle\". Rotations for both melee and range Elf kills can be found in #solak-range-brid and #solak-magic-brid .","title":"Phase 3"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#phase-4","text":"Phase 4 Notes In this phase, Solak is solely focused on Merethiel, and is unable to attack the players. This part of the fight is kill or be killed, similar to Vorago P5, and Solak must be defeated before his mind is consumed by Erethdor's manifestations. As such, there are few mechanics outside of the over-arching mechanic, Solak's Mind. Burst of Nature During P4, Solak gains the ability to deal a large blight hit to all players in the arena, dealing upwards of ~12k damage if not dealt with. Solak takes time to charge this attack, it is released every ~28 seconds, marked by a purple hurricane surrounding him. The damage he deals with this attack can be reduced to ~3k via the use of several stuns, which are as follows: ( / / / / / / / ). These abilities should therefore be used early into the phase, as part of your DPS rotation, and flanked abilities still work to reduce the damage. Blight Bomb Exactly the same as the P1 Blight Bombs, these are given to 2 random players in the arena, with the bar beginning shortly before the Burst of Nature is fully charged. \u2b25 If a player enters the Mind Realm after receiving a blight bomb, upon detonation, they will take no damage from it. Mind Realm In the final Phase of Solak, Erethdor attempts to consume Solak's mind, through his manifestations inside of the Mind Realm. The player's job is to defeat Solak before the manifestations consume Solak. The Mind Realm can be entered in order to protect him, known as \"realming\", and completely avoiding this mechanic and killing Solak is known as \"no-realm\" and requires strong damage. \u2b25 Solak's Mind has 100k HP, regardless of teamsize. This is damaged by manifestations, their damage increases over time and will kill Solak in ~18-24 seconds from when he becomes attackable if left unchecked. The player's health can be sacrificed to heal Solak's mind, healing the equivalent damage taken, each click dealing ~2k damage to the player. This damage is blocked by Barricade , which can be used to safely heal Solak's mind. \u2b25 If Solak's mind is consumed, all players are insta-killed, bypassing the Sign of Life. \u2b25 If the player dies at the same time as Solak, Merethiel will revive them, avoiding their death mechanics. This will still clear the effects of Incense Sticks. \u2b25 Mind Realm Mechanics \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Accessed via the Extra Action button, available from the start of the phase, with a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Mind Realm blocks direct forms of healing such as eating food , drinking potions , or healing portents. Other forms of healing, such as Soulsplit , Excalibur , Phoenix Necklaces , or healing familiars can be used, and are recommended to be used to heal if available. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Up to 2 people can be in the Mind Realm at once, and unlike in P3, players can remain indefinitely. \u2b25 Manifestations \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Erethdor was killed to progress from P3, Manifestations will deal reduced damage to Solak and targeted players. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Erethdor's Manifestations continuously damage Solak's mind, when not aggro'd to a player. Upon being tagged, they shift their focus to the player, and deal weak ~1k magic hits to the player. The longer they are alive, the more damage they deal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Manifestations have 2 spawn mechanics, they spawn on a set interval timer, and also spawn as Solak takes damage, in consistent intervals depending on team size.

Attack Timing The timing to barge Solak before he's vulnerable can be gauged, you should be barging as he flies back from Merethiel (Assuming the animation does not glitch out for you) \u2b25 Barge timing - https://youtu.be/c1wbZZQX7yI \u2b25 Pre-Barge timing - https://youtu.be/DXUujotIZKU","title":"Phase 4"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#realming","text":"Overview When learning or in the case of missing teammates, correctly dealing with the Mind Realm is vital to securing the kill. This can be done effectively in one of two ways, entering immediately or entering late: \u2b25 When in the Mind Realm, make sure to always be praying , activate to heal when needed, and use Fortitude to reduce damage taken. Immediate Entering \u2b25 Entering immediately gives the largest amount of control over the manifestations, as you can easily tag them as they spawn and focus on defensives. This is slower than entering late, but is worthwhile depending on team DPS. \u2b25 As you won't be dealing damage to Solak or Manifestations, all of your adrenaline can be utilised for defensives. \u2b25 Start with Immortality , for the 25% damage reduction for 30s. If the manifestations do not proc immortality before it ends, heal Solak until it procs, to make the most out of it. Whilst building adren, use Reflect and Devotion at low HP to reduce more damage, building for Barricade as the final defensive. Once barricaded, spam click Solak to heal him, whilst tagging new spawns to take their aggro. Entering Late \u2b25 This method is employed if you feel team DPS is lacking, and is a high-risk high-reward strategy. This involves dealing large amounts of damage early into the phase, then entering the Mind Realm to tag manifestations whilst your team finishes the rest of the fight. \u2b25 After dumping thresholds outside, enter the realm and immediately tag every Manifestation available, focusing old before new, making use of Chain and auto-attacks with defensives.

However, starting off with hybrid can be unfamiliar, and is taxing on inventory space, since it greatly reduces the amount of food you can take. It is recommended to be comfortable with both Solak as a boss and with multiple combat styles before learning to hybrid. Hybriding assumes the player starts from a mage or range setup, adding in melee gear in order to make use of Berserk , the ZGS special attack, and the effect of the MW Spear of Annihilation . As such, the most important switches to add are listed below, in order of priority: Mage Hybrid \u2b25 Base Magic setup (DW+2h, Flank, Planted Feet) \u2b25 Melee Legs+Body + Melee DW \u2b25 Melee 2h \u2b25 Masterwork Spear \u2b25 Melee Flanking \u2b25 Melee Helmet \u2b25 EoF Gstaff \u2b25 Melee Boots \u2b25 Borrowed Power Smoke Cloud ( ) The presets below give a rough idea of how presets adapt from a base Magic setup, to a learner Hybrid setup, to an advanced Hybrid Setup.

Some items are more or less useful depending on the role, Base vs DPS: Range Camp Learner Brid Full Range Brid Explanation These switches typically replace food, however as you bring more switches for the hybrid setup, you will have to employ more advanced strategies, such as pre-potting at the bank for inventory spaces. Hybriding isn't just about bringing gear with you, making effective use out of the gear requires well-thought out strategies and optimal ultimate usage to increase damage output. To start off, this can be quite overwhelming, so the strategies below list how to make the most use out of your hybrid setup. Mage Hybrid Start out with the 2 most important Zerks, which are on Solak's Core and P4. These are low risk, as you are not being damaged so you can enjoy the full damage increase without any worry. After this, the next zerks to work into your rotation are listed below, in order of priority: \u2b25 Zerk Core + P4 \u2b25 Zerk Erethdor (If going in solo) \u2b25 Zerk P3 start \u2b25 ZGS Erethdor (If going in duo) \u2b25 Zerk+ZGS Start \u2b25 Zerk P2 start Once you get more comfortable, making more use of the ZGS special attack such as in P1 and on Erethdor is recommended. However, when starting out in larger teams, or for lower DPS teams, using Berserk on Erethdor to start off may find more success, until better strategies are learned. Ranged Hybrid Due to the effectiveness of the ECB special attack, the ZGS special attack sees no use in Range Hybrid. However, the damage from Berserk and the effect of the MW Spear of Annihilation are highly useful for damage output. The next zerks to work into your rotation are listed below, in order of priority: \u2b25 Zerk Core + P4 \u2b25 Zerk Erethdor (If going in solo) \u2b25 Zerk P3 start \u2b25 Zerk Start \u2b25 Zerk P2 start Ranged Hybrid is quite different to Mage Hybrid, as the ECB special attack is so strong. As such, only critical zerks are recommended, and unless the player finds their team DPS lacking, ECB is recommended to use on Erethdor","title":"Introduction to Hybrid"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-mechanics/#benchmarks","text":"What Times Mean Learning a boss requires practice and time, and learning happens at different speeds for everyone. As such, listed below are the benchmarks of killspeeds with certain skips taken into account, and how to transition between them. \u2b25 12+ mins - 3 or 2 cycle core (3/2cc), Hurricane P2, Charging pads P3, Realming P4 \u2b25 10+ mins - 2 cycle core (2cc), 2nd Rain P2, 2 cycle Erethdor, Realming P4 \u2b25 8+ mins - 2 or 1cc (with Bomb skips), 2nd Rain P2, Erethdor, No Realm \u2b25 6+ mins - 1cc (with Root skips), Arm Climb, 1-cycle Erethdor, No realm Improving with your Kill Times Starting off, players are expected to take the boss slowly, and focus more on mechanics. As they become more comfortable, then they can focus more on damage, and obtaining faster kills. \u2b25 12-10 mins - At this point, players are expecting to take it slowly. To improve from here, spend less time dealing with Roots and other mechanics on P1, and aim to make good use of the flank shield for the first Rain attack. Aim to reach the P2 HP cap by the 2nd Rain attack in order to avoid having to use Barricade to deal with the Hurricane. Transition from charging all pads p3 to dealing with erethdor, as this saves easily 2 minutes if the phase can be done in 4 pads. At this point, becoming more comfortable with mechanics is the main focus. \u2b25 10-8 mins - Here you will be working on refining your kills from the 10 min range, getting consistency in your 1 cycle cores, and implementing advanced skips like Bomb skips in P1. After this, phasing solak in P2 consistently with the first hit of the second rain attack, killing Erethdor in 2 cycles and making efficient use of pads. Starting P3 without cleansing is expected by this point. With the use of Berserk or Death's Swiftness and strong damage, No Realm kills are expected to be implemented here, saving 10-15+ seconds. \u2b25 8-6 mins - Here you will be working on consistent 1 cycle cores with advanced skips, Bomb or Root skips. Aim to end P2 with the Arm Climb attack, killing Erethdor in 1 cycle, and consistent, quick No Realm kills. \u2b25 6 mins - At this point, speeding up is a matter of consistency, reaching the timegates of each phase. Fast P1s end around ~1:50, Storm tanking can be used to save ~10s per kill, P2 is timegated to the Arm Climb attack. Aim to finish P3 in 2 pads which are charged immediately, and P4 is a quick No Realm kill.","title":"Benchmarks"},{"location":"pvme-guides/solak/solak-range-brid/","text":"Solak range brid Solak Range-Melee Hybrid (Courtesy of #LiesAndTears) Introduction Due to the increased uptime in damage-boosting abilities, hybrid strategies are employed at Solak. The player can make use of both ranged and melee gear to vastly improve kill speeds, by alternating their respective ultimate abilities. The aim is to always be under an ult, unless making use of bleed abilities with a Masterwork Spear . Solak has a low damage potential and plentiful opportunities to heal, allowing him to be effectively killed with minimal food. Detailed below are the meta rotations for both base and DPS roles for Duo Solak, with the aim of kill-times around ~5:45 . \u2b25 Effectively using Ranged as a combat style requires a large degree of improvisational skills. This is to make the best use of the excess adrenaline gained from Hydrix Bakriminel bolts . As such, rotations are not set in stone and the player's intuition is required to achieve optimal kills, as no two kills will ever be the same. Excess adrenaline can be used through more ECB specs, more EoF Dark Bow specs, or better use of thresholds. \u2b25 The use of an ECB EoF is required for the rotations outlined below. A physical ECB can execute similar rotations, however, making use of SGB EoF special attacks and 4-tick auto attacks with the is required, alongside good improvisation skills. General Notes \u2b25 The guide contains rotations for Root skips, the timings of which can be found in #solak-mechanics . \u2b25 As the beginning of the fight makes use of majority melee abilities, the use of at the adren crystal in PVM hub is highly recommended, to increase damage. \u2b25In duo, it is advised that the DPS pre-places their dominion mines on the SE roots , and the Base on the NW roots . \u2b25 It is easier to apply the Smoke Cloud debuff with Ranged, at the start of Death's Swiftness with the use of Ingenuity of the Humans . Solak, Core, and Erethdor should all be debuffed, and co-ordinate between team members as to who is applying it. Presets General \u2b25 It is assumed that the Spirit Weed , Kwuarm , and Lantadyme incense sticks are used, and an Overload and Weapon Poison +++ is drank at the bank, to save an inventory space. \u2b25 These presets are completely filled, requiring the player to drop a Spiritual at the start of the fight to pick up later when the spot is free, after Dominion mines are placed or another is drank.

With 1 good use of the ECB spec, the boss can phase during the arm climb attack.

As such, only general outlines will be detailed below, and improvisation rotations continue into P3. The general outline is as follows: \u2b25 If you used ECB on Eruptions: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Base Finish spec \u2192 bleeds ( + ) \u2192 ( + ) \u2192 Build to 100% \u2192 Death's Swift \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DPS Finish spec as you go up Erupt \u2192 Build to 100% \u2192 ( + ) \u2192 Build to 100% \u2192 \u2b25 If you did not ECB on Eruptions: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Base bleeds ( + + ) \u2192 ( + ) \u2192 Build to 100% \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DPS Improvise (Snap if high adren) \u2192 go up Erupt \u2192 ( + ) \u2192 Build to 100% \u2192 \u2b25 If Solak is above 1300k HP , use another spec. If below, use \u2b25 A well timed allows the player to save to use in the P3 instead of the P3 \u2b25 The P2 Berserk is a 2 threshold zerk, using sigil to bleed Assault . This is to quicken the build to 100% in order to use Death's Swiftness . \u2b25 The P2 is where the improvisational skills of the player are tested. Hydrix bolts give extremely variable adrenaline, so no two kills will follow the same rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As a general guideline, the player should aim to get 2x Snapshot , 2x Rapid Fire , 1-2x ECB spec , 1+ Dbow EoF spec \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With strong procs, excess adrenaline should be dumped in the form of ECB specs and Dbow EoF specs , before building for when the boss is below 1300k HP. Phase 3 Overview This phase is also split into two parts, the P3 damage phase, and killing Erethdor in the mind realm. It is assumed that the player stays on the north pads to charge it immediately, and moves towards the second pad, one pad SW of the north pad, after Solak finishes shaking. If following the rotations, Solak should be around ~600k HP as he moves towards the second pad, if you find your damage slightly behind, move towards the pad at around ~500k HP. \u2b25 Depending on how the player ends P2, rotations are provided with and without the use of Natural Instinct P3 Rotations \u2b25 Rotation without \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Base + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DPS + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 \u2b25 Rotation with \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Base \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DPS \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2b25 The P3 follows another improvisational rotation similar to P2, with the general guidelines outlined below: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The player should aim to get 2x Snapshot , 1-2x Rapid Fire , 1-2x ECB spec , 1+ Dbow EoF spec \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With strong procs, excess adrenaline should be dumped in the form of ECB specs and Dbow EoF specs , \u200e \u200eaiming to end P3 above a minimum of 30% adrenaline as you enter the mind realm.

P3 Rotation \u2b25 Depending on whether a damaging ability or were used at the end of P2, use the opposite to hit 100% for Death's Swiftness . \u2b25 The P3 is similar to P1 and P2, with much greater use of thresholds and due to the greatly increased adrenaline gain from the buff. The general outlines are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1x ECB , 2x SGB (1 last tick of DS), 1-2x Snap , 2x Rapid , 1-3x Dbow \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Save 1 stun ( / ) for the 2nd pad. \u2b25 After DS ends, 1-2 ECB specs will be required to finish the remaining HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Co-ordinate with the base as to who uses Fragmentation Shot as he moves. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Aim to enter the mind realm with above ~30% adrenaline, if necessary, use to get off thresholds.

Telos is a solo boss that can only be fought after obtaining the four parts of an Ancient Sigil from the four other bosses in the Heart requiring 80 in Attack, Prayer, Magic, and Ranged. Telos is regarded as the most profitable boss currently once a player is able to consistently kill and streak high enrages. Telos drops t92 two-hand weapons consisting of the Staff of Sliske , Zaros Godsword , and Seren Godbow . Telos has a unique looting mechanic where players can choose to risk the drops from a kill for increased chance of better loot at the cost of a more difficult fight known as streaking. Each kill players choose to forgo claiming the loot increases enrage between 5-20%. As enrage increases, mechanics are added to the fight as well as every mistake being much more punishing. A successful kill at 500% enrage unlocks the green Warden title, a successful kill at 2000% enrage unlocks the silver Warden title, and enrage is capped at 4000% where a successful kill will unlock the golden Warden title. On phases 1 and 2, Telos will attack with melee unless players are out of range. When out of range, Telos will shoot off a magic attack and move into melee distance again. Phase 3 is only magic auto attacks. On phase 4, the only difference with autos from phases 1 and 2 is when players are out of range, Telos will continue to use magic autos rather than move into melee range. \u200ePhase 5, Telos will only use magic auto attacks.

Phase 5 is simple - just target cycle as soon as you see Telos' head pop up, or as soon as you see the yellow dot on the minimap. Your target range must be set to max for this to work. For phase 1, you need to trigger GCD (using Devotion ) wait 2 ticks then Surge in (off gcd) and sun on the next tick. Wait 3 ticks then target cycle + abil. Be aware that if your first abil splashes, it can cause Telos' first auto to hit 2 ticks earlier. https://youtu.be/h1v5kS9I50w Phase 1 Attack Rotation 7 Autos \u2192 Tendrils \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Uppercut \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Hold Still \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Repeat from tendrils until phased Mechanics \u2b25 On P1, a green beam will spawn on Telos and then stay for 20 ticks.

Telos also drains your adrenaline while channeling this spec so it's important to clear it quickly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should aim to use a high damage ability like Dragonbreath , Wild Magic or Guthix staff spec to cancel this. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As enrage goes up it becomes increasingly important to stack damage properly, so it's recommended to use Ice Barrage + Detonate \u200e \u200e + Wrack as these will all hit on the same tick.

While players stand in the beam, they take and deal 30% reduced damage. While Telos stands in the beam, his special bar will fill and he will take 20% less damage. \u2b25 Telos will fire off Magic Onslaught hits until his bar is empty. He cannot be moved during this, so if he is standing in the beam, players must block the beam to negate the bar filling. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Devotion and Deflect Mage the orange/red attacks if his bar was relatively full before the attack started. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Other damage reducing abilities, such as Debilitate and Reflect ), will also reduce the damage taken. \u2b25 The virus damage is negligible at low enrages, but it can really cut into your food if not dealt with quickly at higher enrages so you should aim to clear this as quickly as possible. \u2b25 Deal with the other mechanics the same as you would on P1 and DPS until phase HP. Ideally you phase before the virus even comes out, but this is heavily influenced by your P1 rotation. It's important not to end the phase with Tendrils as the previous spec unless you are confident dealing with Hold Still as the first spec on P3.

Refer to diagram. Assuming phase after virus and before uppercut. 7 Autos \u2192 Uppercut \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Hold Still \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Virus (if 50%+ enrage; skips this spec if <50%) \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Repeat from Uppercut until phase hp Mechanics \u2b25 On P3, a red beam will spawn at a random location, lasting for 33 ticks. While players are standing in the beam, they will take and deal 30% increased damage. While Telos is in the beam, he will deal 30% increased damage. \u2b25 Telos can apply a Red Virus on this phase. \u2b25 Telos\u2019s special bar is replaced by a balancing bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the bar is in the red on the left, Telos will siphon player\u2019s prayer and adrenaline. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the bar is in the red on the right, Telos will send out a shockwave dealing typeless damage. \u2b25 Telos\u2019 bar charges to the right when he is standing in the beam or golems are alive. Telos' bar naturally moves to the left otherwise. A mini-golem \u2b25 When the balance is in the red on the right, Telos will emit one shockwave along with Uppercut and Hold Still. Depending on how far the bar is to the right, Telos will emit up to three shockwaves with the virus. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The shockwave can easily nuke players at higher enrages. Reflect , Debilitate , or even Barricade can be used to survive being nuked. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 On the other end, at 3500%+ enrage, player\u2019s will be smited if Telos is not allowed to step into the beam for a tick. \u2b25 When starting out, players can escape into the corner to ensure Telos does not have a beam spawn on him. Once comfortable, it is better to not move from drop down to get into the beam as fast as possible. Once the beam spawns, Bladed Dive into it to decrease the likelihood Telos walk over you into the beam. \u2b25 The worst case scenario is ending P2 on Tendrils because the first spec on P3 will be Hold Still, so Onslaught cannot be fully used to dump DPS and the phase can take longer than needed. If this happens, it is often better to just dump thresholds in the beam dealing with mechanics as they come and killing golems if needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can also use Limitless if necessary. Phase 3 Rotations (250%-999%) Recommended Rotation \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e\u2192 (3t) \u200e \u200e\u2192 + Old Rotations https://i.imgur.com/fKsuypa.png Phase 4 Attack Rotation Again, first spec depends on last spec from P3. Refer to diagram. Assuming last spec on P3 was Uppercut. 3 Autos \u2192 Uppercut \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Weak Anima Bomb \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Hold Still \u2192 Repeat until Telos reaches 0 hp Mechanics \u2b25 The one new special is the Weak Anima Bomb which can be dealt with using Debilitate on Telos or Resonance if phasing into a font before Hold Still. \u2b25 No beams spawn on P4; however, there are three fonts which must be filled and used to negate the instakill attack. The Pure font (next to where you drop down) becomes active when Telos is at \u00be hp, Volcanic at \u00bd hp, and Corrupt at \u00bc hp, moving clockwise around the arena. \u2b25 Telos\u2019s number of auto attacks between specs carries over from font to font, so if Telos was one auto attack from firing off a Weak Anima Bomb before the font became active, there will only be one attack before the weak anima bomb after the instakill. There is a slight caveat with phasing on Hold Still that will be discussed later. \u2b25 When these fonts become active, Telos is immune to damage and one of each type of golem spawns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pure golems (green) deal increased damage the longer they are alive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Volcanic golems (red) will occasionally stun and bind players for five ticks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The priority is to always kill or inmobilize the red golem(s) as quickly as possible to avoid stuns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Corrupt golems (black) reduce player\u2019s defensive rating by 1% for each stack up to 100 stacks. \u2b25 Players must stand in each font to charge it. Players will take five hits of typeless damage which can be reduced with Reflect except for the last hit which can only be negated with Barricade \u2b25 After using the font to negate the instakill, player\u2019s defensives will be reset and put on a 10 tick cooldown. \u2b25 Barring taking an eternity to get into the first and third fonts, most players will receive a So Much Power in place of the next spec after the second font. \u2b25 The best way to deal with SMP is to just Resonance or Disruption Shield the hit as this completely negates the hit while preserving adrenaline. SMP behaves much like Hold Still in the sense that an auto attack comes before the actual big damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Be sure to Resonance the SMP not the auto attack. \u2b25 When trying to Resonance SMP with golems still alive, Surge away so their hits don't snipe Resonance, or Devotion + Deflect Melee \u2192 Resonance the SMP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At lower enrages a Spirit shield can be used to reduce the hit from SMP to a survivable number. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If phasing into the font with one or zero autos before the next spec, Telos will have to be stun-locked to allow for defensives to come off cooldown to deal with SMP. \u2b25 Continue to DPS and deal with mechanics until Telos\u2019s HP hits 0. If <100% enrage, congratulations on loot. Phase 4 Rotations (250%-999%) Objective \u2b25 Goal with P4 is to minimise the number of specs (and hence autos aswell) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is done by using Ice Barrage as each font ends in order to break Telos' freedom and allow effective stunlocking immediately - meaning ideally no autos between each font. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If executed properly you won't get any specs this phase - if you do, use where convenient. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Always use AoE abilties on golems for adrenaline between fonts excluding for the Third Font. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 First and Third font are assumed you use 2H for all abilities used on Telos.

It will always follow this rotation. Phase 5 only occurs at 100+ enrage. Golem Spawn \u2192 10 Autos \u2192 Virus \u2192 17 Autos \u2192 Instant-Kill Bomb \u2192 2 Autos \u2192 Repeat from beginning until dead Mechanics \u2b25 At the start Telos will spawn a particular set of six golems (Pure, Corrupt, or Volcanic). \u2b25 On P5 <1000% enrage, a single rock will fall at certain times during the phase. 1000%+ enrage up to five rocks will fall. \u2b25 All three colored beams will spawn on Telos having the same effects from earlier phases. \u2b25 Fonting is the process of killing the golems at their corresponding font to be used during the insta-kill bomb. \u2b25 <1000% enrage just wipe the golems out because Immortality can still be used to negate the insta-kill Bomb. \u2b25 A simple Tsunami inside Sunshine is enough to wipe golems up to ~350% enrage with some basics to kill any stray golems. \u2b25 After ~350% a Deto + Tsunami will be needed to kill the golems. \u2b25 After 1000% golems will have to be fonted if not comfortable zero-fonting. Whittle down the golems with AoEs before clearing the virus and killing them at the font. \u2b25 The virus will be a random color. Surge /bladed dive to the beam to cleanse the virus, head back to Sunshine and the green beam as fast as possible. A player with Green Virus, exclusive to Phase 5 \u2b25 If not fonting wait for the next rock to fall, onslaught until either Telos dies or the next rock falls. \u2b25 <1000% Immortality to negate the Insta-Kill Bomb Telos charging his attack \u2b25 1000%+ activate the font and get back onto Telos. \u2b25 Continue to DPS Telos until he dies. Finally, congratulations on loot. Tips and Tricks \u2b25 To properly tag P5 on the first tick, watch the pure font on the left side, when it does this animation https://i.imgur.com/H3CceEu.gif , press target cycle. If using a Vulnerability Bomb you must throw it one tick after target cycling. \u2b25 Telos auto-attacks can hit surprisingly hard, so make sure you use Deflect Magic at the start of the phase. Use Deflect Melee whenever Telos is stunlocked, while minions are alive. Ideally, you should prayer flick between both deflects. \u2b25 Dreadnips are helpful for complete learners. They have a chance of stunning Telos and consequently triggering his freedom timer - especially helpful during P5 start and your Onslaught . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These will be ditched as you become more experienced however. \u2b25 Telos' Freedom is triggered on a set timer, starting from the beginning of P5, as long as you stun or bind him at any point between his freedoms. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This means that with a 20-second freedom (on 250-999%), and Asphyxiate having a cooldown of 20 seconds, your Asphyxiate + Deep Impact combo will always stunlock Telos if used properly. Take advantage of this! \u2b25 In the event that you get an instant kill, use Immortality + Sunshine and Vulnerability Bomb \u200e \u200e . Rotate defensives such as Reflect / Debilitate / Devotion / Barricade while finishing Telos. Using Revenge is recommended. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Anticipation and Freedom if you get Volcanics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The general idea behind this is to maximize damage output on Telos while having defensives up to tank minions. \u2b25 Minion luring is important for side beams, simply standing 1 out of MD will generally lure the golems properly. For back beams, you want to stand 1 out of MD, then move 2 squares back to lure the golems. Here is an image detailing the lure: Enrage Checkpoints \u2b25 100-149% : and under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos cannot use Freedom at this enrage - with stuns and a Sunshine rotation, you should be able to kill him before virus. \u2b25 150-249% : under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos will start using Freedom every 30 seconds, however there is no immunity period after using it. You can either tank the virus with Revenge / Reprisal or clear it. This is easily 0 fontable. \u2b25 250-349% : Tsunami under Sunshine will generally kill all of the minions, but you may need to start using and to clear out remainders. Telos will also start using Freedom every 20 seconds, with a 6 second immunity period, and will remain that way all the way to 999%. You should start to learn to clear the virus efficiently - use Debilitate on the virus for safety. \u2b25 350-999% : Detonate + Tsunami under Sunshine will kill all or most of the minions. Using a Kalphite Rebounder and Revenge may be useful for dealing with the minions, especially if you have Ruthless on your defender. At this point, you can Debilitate the virus if it comes out, or Barricade if low on food, though neither is strictly necessary. DPS and stunning becomes increasingly important in order to get a 0 font.

Telos is regarded as the most profitable boss currently once a player is able to consistently kill and streak high enrages. Telos drops t92 two-hand weapons consisting of the Staff of Sliske , Zaros Godsword , and Seren Godbow . Telos has a unique looting mechanic where players can choose to risk the drops from a kill for increased chance of better loot at the cost of a more difficult fight known as streaking. Each kill players choose to forgo claiming the loot increases enrage between 5-20%. As enrage increases, mechanics are added to the fight as well as every mistake being much more punishing. A successful kill at 500% enrage unlocks the green Warden title, a successful kill at 2000% enrage unlocks the silver Warden title, and enrage is capped at 4000% where a successful kill will unlock the golden Warden title. On phases 1 and 2, Telos will attack with melee unless players are out of range. When out of range, Telos will shoot off a magic attack and move into melee distance again.

Once the beam spawns, Bladed Dive into it to decrease the likelihood Telos walk over you into the beam. \u2b25 The worst case scenario is ending P2 on Tendrils because the first spec on P3 will be Hold Still, so Onslaught cannot be fully used to dump DPS and the phase can take longer than needed. If this happens, it is often better to just dump thresholds in the beam dealing with mechanics as they come and killing golems if needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can also use Limitless if necessary.","title":"Phase 3"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-0-999-magic/#phase-3-rotations-250-999","text":"Recommended Rotation \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e\u2192 (3t) \u200e \u200e\u2192 + Old Rotations https://i.imgur.com/fKsuypa.png","title":"Phase 3 Rotations (250%-999%)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-0-999-magic/#phase-4","text":"Attack Rotation Again, first spec depends on last spec from P3.

The Pure font (next to where you drop down) becomes active when Telos is at \u00be hp, Volcanic at \u00bd hp, and Corrupt at \u00bc hp, moving clockwise around the arena. \u2b25 Telos\u2019s number of auto attacks between specs carries over from font to font, so if Telos was one auto attack from firing off a Weak Anima Bomb before the font became active, there will only be one attack before the weak anima bomb after the instakill. There is a slight caveat with phasing on Hold Still that will be discussed later. \u2b25 When these fonts become active, Telos is immune to damage and one of each type of golem spawns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pure golems (green) deal increased damage the longer they are alive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Volcanic golems (red) will occasionally stun and bind players for five ticks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The priority is to always kill or inmobilize the red golem(s) as quickly as possible to avoid stuns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Corrupt golems (black) reduce player\u2019s defensive rating by 1% for each stack up to 100 stacks. \u2b25 Players must stand in each font to charge it.

Finally, congratulations on loot. Tips and Tricks \u2b25 To properly tag P5 on the first tick, watch the pure font on the left side, when it does this animation https://i.imgur.com/H3CceEu.gif , press target cycle. If using a Vulnerability Bomb you must throw it one tick after target cycling. \u2b25 Telos auto-attacks can hit surprisingly hard, so make sure you use Deflect Magic at the start of the phase. Use Deflect Melee whenever Telos is stunlocked, while minions are alive. Ideally, you should prayer flick between both deflects. \u2b25 Dreadnips are helpful for complete learners. They have a chance of stunning Telos and consequently triggering his freedom timer - especially helpful during P5 start and your Onslaught . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These will be ditched as you become more experienced however. \u2b25 Telos' Freedom is triggered on a set timer, starting from the beginning of P5, as long as you stun or bind him at any point between his freedoms. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This means that with a 20-second freedom (on 250-999%), and Asphyxiate having a cooldown of 20 seconds, your Asphyxiate + Deep Impact combo will always stunlock Telos if used properly. Take advantage of this! \u2b25 In the event that you get an instant kill, use Immortality + Sunshine and Vulnerability Bomb \u200e \u200e . Rotate defensives such as Reflect / Debilitate / Devotion / Barricade while finishing Telos. Using Revenge is recommended. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Anticipation and Freedom if you get Volcanics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The general idea behind this is to maximize damage output on Telos while having defensives up to tank minions. \u2b25 Minion luring is important for side beams, simply standing 1 out of MD will generally lure the golems properly. For back beams, you want to stand 1 out of MD, then move 2 squares back to lure the golems. Here is an image detailing the lure: Enrage Checkpoints \u2b25 100-149% : and under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos cannot use Freedom at this enrage - with stuns and a Sunshine rotation, you should be able to kill him before virus. \u2b25 150-249% : under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos will start using Freedom every 30 seconds, however there is no immunity period after using it. You can either tank the virus with Revenge / Reprisal or clear it. This is easily 0 fontable. \u2b25 250-349% : Tsunami under Sunshine will generally kill all of the minions, but you may need to start using and to clear out remainders. Telos will also start using Freedom every 20 seconds, with a 6 second immunity period, and will remain that way all the way to 999%. You should start to learn to clear the virus efficiently - use Debilitate on the virus for safety. \u2b25 350-999% : Detonate + Tsunami under Sunshine will kill all or most of the minions. Using a Kalphite Rebounder and Revenge may be useful for dealing with the minions, especially if you have Ruthless on your defender. At this point, you can Debilitate the virus if it comes out, or Barricade if low on food, though neither is strictly necessary. DPS and stunning becomes increasingly important in order to get a 0 font.","title":"Phase 5"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-0-999-magic/#phase-5-rotations-250-999","text":"Note: Autos are intentionally omitted for the sake of stunlocking Left Beam (TC) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + (3-hit) \u2192 + \u2192 golems + Telos \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (TC) / \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 spam \u2192 / depending on HP and food left.

It's important to be aware that due to the shorter freedom CD at 1k+, you will have to stun more in order to prevent specs. After your asphyxiate at the beginning of the phase, you should take a step forward and escape or run back to the corner. Taking a step forward ensures that the black beam spawns mid arena and prevents telos from pre-walking your escape which will help keep telos out of the beam when it changes. As Telos' autos at this enrage start to deal more damage, it becomes heavily encouraged to stay out of melee distance of Telos, as his mage autos do less damage than melee. Using escape prior to detonate will allow you to force force mage autos, while keeping you within familiar range and maximum weapon range. Phase 2 can have a lot of variance depending on hit and vengence RNG. Ideally if less than two venges were needed in P1, you will be able to use 2 venges in P2.

It's important to be aware that due to the shorter freedom CD at 1k+, you will have to stun more in order to prevent specs. After your asphyxiate at the beginning of the phase, you should take a step forward and escape or run back to the corner. Taking a step forward ensures that the black beam spawns mid arena and prevents telos from pre-walking your escape which will help keep telos out of the beam when it changes. As Telos' autos at this enrage start to deal more damage, it becomes heavily encouraged to stay out of melee distance of Telos, as his mage autos do less damage than melee. Using escape prior to detonate will allow you to force force mage autos, while keeping you within familiar range and maximum weapon range.

There will be no discussion of what is \"optimal\", this is a subjective collection of tips and instructions intended solely to make getting initial experience at a boss easier - as a result of this it will be fairly general and try not to cater too much to any specific style. This also makes it reasonably Revolution friendly. It's difficult to try and write this guide as someone who already has hundreds of hours at the boss, so please don't hesitate to tag or dm me any feedback. While the Freedom timer is relevant at 150%+ enrage, in order to keep things concise, this guide will not pay too much attention to it. Presets General \u2b25 These presets are meant to be general guidelines. As this guide is intentionally non-specific with respect to exact rotations, you can downgrade/upgrade gear wherever necessary, including changing the ratio of Sailfish / Blue Blubber Jellyfish / Saradomin Brew , or bringing fewer Super Restores . \u2b25 Some of these presets do not include a Ring of Death . Due to prices constantly fluctuating and these presets being quite flexible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It's strongly recommended to compare your death cost with a standard DPS ring to the cost of death with a Ring of Death (currently 1,084,119). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make sure to also include the cost of your familiar and any supplies kept inside. \u2b25 A Pack Mammoth is used to ensure survivability, with the expectation that you will tank some specs just by virtue of being unfamiliar with the boss. This can be downgraded to whatever your best Beast of Burden is. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Mammoth scrolls allows your Mammoth to consume food without you losing adren, and will only consume Sailfish , so this should be used throughout the fight. This can also be used alongside regular eating, allowing you to heal a considerable amount in 1 tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When you are confident with specs you can switch this for a Ripper demon . \u2b25 Some regular Sailfish are included in the inventory to allow you to overheal to reduce the chance of death when tanking a high hit. \u2b25 Bladed Dive is strongly recommended to help with mobility including getting into beams to clear virus, as well as moving around on both P4 and P5. \u2b25 Spirit shields are used for their 30% damage reduction - greatly improving survivability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Any regular shield (the higher tier the better) will also work though. \u2b25 Expensive Spices are brought to boost the healing of Sailfish and Blue Blubber Jellyfish by 50 hp. This is not a requirement but can be useful. \u2b25 As this is a beginner guide with accessibility prioritised, it is assumed you won't DW + 2h swap (beyond applying Black Stone Arrows with Ranged). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However doing so will obviously help with damage output. Magic \u2b25 This magic preset uses an Inquisitor's Staff due to it being specifically good against Telos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can be downgraded to a Noxious Staff or equivalent. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Similarly dual-wield magic is more than good enough. \u2b25 The Seismic Wand in this preset has Planted Feet on it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It's useful to have this on a high tier weapon as it is used to kill minions on P4 with a shield equipped, but this can still be downgraded to a Wand of the Cywir Elders or even Virtus Wand if necessary. \u2b25 Rune Pouch : \u2b25 Rune Pouch : \u2b25 Rune Pouch : \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These give access to Blood spells Blood Barrage (for healing), Ice spells (for binding minions), Spellbook Swap , Disruption Shield , Vengeance and Shield Dome . You should be on the Ancient spellbook. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you don't wish to use combo runes, you can replace the Mud runes with + in your inventory (or vice versa). \u2b25 Potential upgrades include: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blessed Flask \u200e \u200eto save inventory spots used for Super Restores. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Statius's Warhammer for accuracy (to be used with Ingenuity of the Humans on Phase 1 and Phase 4 dropdown). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seren Godbow \u200e \u200e(to use the spec with Ingenuity of the Humans on Phase 5). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seismic Singularity \u200e \u200eto 4taa with. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ancient lantern \u200e \u200ewith Planted Feet to aid with damage on P4 fonts (optionally using Revenge ). Ranged (Ascensions) \u2b25 This ranged preset assumes you will be primarily camping Ascension Crossbows with Onyx Bakriminel Bolts (e) and \u200e \u200eHydrix Bakriminel Bolts (e) . \u2b25 Zaryte bow is used solely to apply Black Stone arrows on Phase 1, greatly improving accuracy from P1-4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If your P5 is particularly slow you may consider bringing extra arrows to apply, though this is unlikely to be worthwhile. \u2b25 Mechanised chinchompa \u200e \u200eare used to AoE minions during fonts on P4, and on P5. \u2b25 Rune Pouch : (Runes for Disruption Shield . Must be on Lunars for this.) \u2b25 Potential upgrades include: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blessed Flask \u200e \u200eto save inventory spots used for Super Restores. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u200e \u200e Seren Godbow . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Note: If you have this, it may be better to camp it instead of bringing Ascensions . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ancient Repriser with Planted Feet to aid with damage on P4 fonts (optionally using Revenge ). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Essence of Finality with a Dark Bow stored. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This helps considerably with P4, P5 and general dps. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Extra Rune Pouch : (Runes for Vengeance ) Ranged (Noxious Longbow) \u2b25 This ranged preset assumes you will be camping a Noxious Longbow . \u2b25 You should apply Black Stone arrows on Phase 1, greatly improving accuracy from P1-4. They will also be applied on Phase 5. If you wish to avoid using extra arrows you can consider bringing Araxyte arrows as a switch. \u2b25 Mechanised chinchompa are used along with an off-hand Shadow glaive to AoE minions during fonts on P4, and on P5. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The off-hand Shadow glaive is not required, but strongly recommended. \u2b25 The Stalker's ring is used as it gives 3% crit bonus while using a bow. Check death costs with your setup to determine if it is worth using over a Ring of Death . \u2b25 Rune Pouch : (Runes for Disruption Shield . Must be on Lunars for this.) \u2b25 Potential upgrades include: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blessed flask \u200e \u200eto save inventory spots used for Super Restores. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u200e \u200e Seren godbow . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Note: If you have this, camp it instead of the Noxious Longbow . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ancient Repriser with Planted Feet to aid with damage on P4 fonts (optionally using Revenge ). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Essence of Finality with a Dark Bow stored. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This helps considerably with P4, P5 and general dps. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Extra Rune Pouch : (Runes for Vengeance ) Melee \u2b25 This melee preset assumes you will be camping Drygores however using a 2h weapon as a switch is useful. \u2b25 You should use the Statius's Warhammer special frequently in order to maintain good accuracy. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Quake can also be used if necessary. \u2b25 Laniakea's Spear is used for AoEing minions on P4 and P5, but can also be used against Telos. \u2b25 Rune Pouch : (Runes for Disruption Shield . Must be on Lunars for this.) \u2b25 Potential upgrades include: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blessed Flask \u200e \u200eto save inventory spots used for Super Restores. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seren Godbow \u200e \u200e(to use the spec with Ingenuity of the Humans on Phase 5). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Armour spikes (alloy) in order to help with dealing damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Essence of Finality with Dragon claws stored - this helps considerably with P5. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Erethdor's Grimoire can also be used (optionally as a switch) to help with damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Extra Rune Pouch : (Runes for Vengeance ) Overview of the Fight General Overview Telos starts with 400k HP (scaling up to 600k HP at 200% enrage), split evenly between Phases 1 to 4. Phase 5 has 100k HP at 100% enrage (scaling up to 200k HP at 300% enrage). \u2b25 The spec order carries across phases, with the colour of the first spec in the next phase corresponding to the same colour of the last spec in the previous phase. For example, if your last spec on P1 was Tendrils (green), the first spec on P2 will be onslaught. The yellow boxes also go to Charge on p3. \u2b25 There are 3 autos between every spec on Phases 1-4. This number of autos does not reset between p1 and p2, but it does at the end of every other phase. \u2b25 Phase 1 starts with 7 autos before the first spec. \u2b25 Phase 3 starts with 7 autos before the first spec (10 autos if the last spec on P2 was hold still, virus, or uppercut). \u2b25 Phase 5 has 10 autos before virus, and 17 autos between virus and instakill. It is not usually necessary to count these autos though. Phase Overview \u2b25 Phase 1: A green beam will spawn sporadically, gbiving 10% adrenaline per tick when you stand in it. This bar will also charge Telos' spec bar until he uses a \"So Much Power\" special attack, if he's stood in the beam. Telos will primarily deal melee attacks on this phase, only resorting to mage when you are far away. \u2b25 Phase 2: A Black beam will consistently spawn on Telos charging his spec bar. This beam changes locations every 20 seconds. The Magic Onslaught special will drain this spec bar and will continue until the spec bar is empty. Telos will primarily deal melee attacks on this phase, only resorting to mage when you are far away. \u2b25 Phase 3: A Red beam will consistently spawn in a semi-random location. This increases the damage you deal (and take) while stood in the beam. If Telos is stood in the beam, his spec bar will be charged which can lead to you getting nuked by Telos if it makes it onto the red right side. If it is on the red left side of the spec bar, your adrenaline and prayer will get drained occasionally. Three golems will also spawn, one at a time, as the phase progresses. If killed, they will respawn after a certain amount of time. Telos will only deal mage autos on this phase. \u2b25 Phase 4: Every 1/4 of phase hp, Telos will become untargetable and charge an instakill while you charge a font by standing close to it. The font will hit you 5 times, after which the font hp will hit 0 and the font will spawn an anima shield. Telos will release the instakill and you stand close to the font to avoid getting killed. When the instakill is released your defensives get put on cooldown for 6s. Telos will primarily deal melee attacks on this phase, only resorting to mage when you are far away. \u2b25 Phase 5: (100%+ enr only) All three beams spawn on Telos in a random arrangement. The beams swap places every 36 seconds. Telos charges an instakill throughout this phase. The green beam will speed up Telos' autos so it's important to block it as much as possible. Telos will only deal mage autos on this phase. Mechanics Tendrils \u2b25 This spec will bind you in place and drain your hp and adrenaline until you do a certain amount of damage (3000 + 10 \u00d7 Enrage). \u2b25 No need to anticipate this, just react to it and use a strong ability like Guthix staff / Snap Shot / Greater Ricochet / Hurricane Uppercut (Charge) \u2b25 Telos will lift his arm and charge an uppercut towards you, dealing damage when he releases it. \u2b25 You can avoid all damage by using Surge / Escape / Bladed Dive and travelling at least 3 squares. The correct time to do this is 1 tick after you see Telos' overhead text disappear. \u2b25 Resonance will work to negate this damage, but it's generally a low amount of damage so worth trying to learn the correct timing. \u2b25 No need to anticipate this, just react to it and learn when to Surge / Escape / Bladed Dive . Hold Still (Stun) \u2b25 Telos will hit you with one small auto, followed by a large melee hit which will bind and stun you if you don't have Anticipate / Freedom up. Telos will then jump on the location where you stood when you took the large melee hit, dealing a 5x5 AoE attack and blocking you from using overhead prayers for a short time. You can walk away to avoid this. \u2b25 The small auto counts towards the 3 autos till next spec, so there will only be 2 further autos before the next spec. \u2b25 By far the most important spec to learn. Need to anticipate it and use Anticipate / Freedom in advance, then Resonance after you get hit with the small auto (which can splash) to res the large hit, this is important for both healing and damage mitigation. \u2b25 While learning it's advised you camp melee prayer for this. You can also use Devotion + Deflect Melee if not confident using Resonance to completely negate the melee hit. You will still need to Anticipate / Freedom though. \u2b25 If you forget to Anticipate / Freedom , you can click your shield from inventory and spam Resonance in order to negate the hit splat from the jump. Magical Onslaught \u2b25 The black beam will fill Telos' anima as long as he's standing on the beam. Once this special attack comes, he will fire gradually stronger Magic auto-attacks until the bar is depleted. \u2b25 Telos will become immobilised during this special so it's important you block the beam by standing in it because you won't be able to walk him out of the beam. Virus \u2b25 This only occurs at 50%+ enrage. \u2b25 This attack deals a small amount of damage every tick, until you stand in the beam. \u2b25 No need to anticipate this, just move to beam when you notice it. \u2b25 You can use Reflect / Debilitate to reduce this but this is not worthwhile. Green virus, phase 5 only Black virus, phase 2 and 5 Red virus, phase 3 and 5 Shockwaves \u2b25 Rapid, hard hitting typeless hit used by Telos if he's overcharged by the Red Beam and the mini-golems in Phase 3. Shockwaves unleashed Drain \u2b25 Telos drains your adrenaline and prayer to charge his anima, used if his anima is over the left red bar on Phase 3. Phase 4 Fonts \u2b25 Once Telos hits a fourth of his health, he will kneel down and absorb the anima from the Pure \u2192 Volcanic \u2192 Corrupt font. Also spawning a Golem of each anima type with varying effects: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Pure anima-golem (green) Golem hits increasingly harder the longer he's left alive. (Currently bugged and deals very low melee hits) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Volcanic anima-golem (red) golem periodically stuns you with his attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Corrupted anima-golem (black) golem shreds your armour, reducing your defences. \u2b25 The font has an area of 6x6 (the font object is 2x2, but you can stand in a 2 square radius outside of this). Standing in the font will deal damage to you 5 times, until the font runs out of HP, at which point it will create an Anima shield of the same size. Once the font is fully charged, or if it is ignored for too long, he will launch the instakill, killing you unless you are stood inside the Anima shield. Weak Anima Bomb \u2b25 Telos will fire a large slow-moving orb towards you that will hit for reasonably high damage. \u2b25 This attack turns you green and does constant damage and drains Overload timers until you stand in one of the fonts. \u2b25 Don't massively need to anticipate this - make sure you run to a font as Telos releases it. \u2b25 All defensives work on this, though Resonance will not heal you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Recommended to use Shield Dome / Resonance / Disruption Shield (if not saving it for So Much Power). So Much Power! (SMP) \u2b25 When Telos' spec bar is full on Phase 4 (also on Phase 1, though this is unlikely), his next spec will be replaced by this. He will say \"SO. MUCH. POWER!\" and fire one small auto, then one very hard hitting typeless hit. This small auto counts towards the 3 autos till next spec. \u2b25 It is not advised to tank this spec without the use of defensives or Vitality potion . \u2b25 By far the most important part of P4 because it frequently happens soon after he fires his instakill at a font, and hence your defensives will be on cooldown. For this reason, you should try to phase Telos into a font immediately after a spec, in order to give you 3 autos for your defensives to come off cooldown. \u2b25 Aim to Devotion + Resonance where possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Aim to be within melee distance of Telos for this so you can use Deflect Melee and devotion will stop your res sniped by Telos or any minions that may be alive. If you are going to get a mage auto, ensure you aren't close to any minions and Deflect Mage will be sufficient. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you can't Devotion + Resonance , use Vitality potion + Resonance / Disruption Shield out of distance of minions. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Shield Dome and vitality pot should also be used as a last resort. Rockfall \u2b25 Below 1,000% enrage, Telos periodically drops a single rock on P5 which deals heavy typeless damage if stood in a 5x5 area around the rockfall. Phase 5 Instakill \u2b25 Telos will charge this instakill with every auto on P5. When Telos finishes charging it, he will stop attacking and raise both arms. After it is released the bar progress is reset and this spec repeats. \u2b25 This instakill can be negated by using the Immortality ability, or charging a font (kill 4 golems next to their respective font) though this is impractical and generally avoided. Phase 1 Strategy \u2b25 Planted feet Sunshine start. If melee you can pre-dbaxe at the adren crystal, and zerk start if you have limitless sigil. \u2b25 Camp Soul Split for entire phase (can put Deflect Melee on when Hold Still is near to give you more safety). \u2b25 Focus on dpsing Telos and don't worry too much about counting autos or preparing for specs (until after Uppercut). \u2b25 Prioritise debuffs (Vulnerability , aiming to Guthix staff / Statius warhammer before worrying about using thresholds. If ranging you should apply Black Stone arrows before switching to your regular ammo (either Ascensions + Bakriminel bolts, or just to Araxyte arrows if camping Nox bow). \u2b25 Dreadnips should be used throughout P1. \u2b25 Stun as much as you can. \u2b25 Stand in green beam whenever it spawns. Points of Improvement \u2b25 Try to time the ability you use to break Tendrils to ensure Telos doesn't heal. \u2b25 Learn to target cycle (tc) p1 as this can give you extra time in the phase by delaying Telos' first auto. \u2b25 Try to line up your stuns so they're 1 tick before Telos would normally auto. This maximises the delay. \u2b25 If you're doing an enrage above 150%, try to break Telos' freedom with a worse stun like Impact / Binding Shot / Backhand (or a bind like Rapid Fire / Barge ), to ensure longer stuns like Asphyxiate / Deep Impact / Tight Bindings / Forceful Backhand / Destroy aren't wasted. \u2b25 Soul Split + Deflect Melee prayer flicking. Phase 2 Strategy \u2b25 Mobility is key to keep Telos out of the beam so using Sunshine/Death's swiftness/ZGS spec isn't recommended. The beam reduces your damage dealt to Telos, so try to walk perpendicular to the beam to drag him out. At the start of the phase, wait until the beam spawns before trying to move him. \u2b25 Camp Soul Split for entire phase. Can use Deflect Mage during the mage onslaught if it is prolonged. You can also put Deflect Melee on when Hold Still is near to give you more safety. \u2b25 Do not use a dreadnip on this phase. \u2b25 Focus on maintaining debuffs. Stunning is less important than on P1 but can still be useful. \u2b25 Try not to phase either immediately, or during the 3 autos, after Tendrils as this will make P3 much harder due to the first spec being Hold Still. \u2b25 Try to have 100% adrenaline at phase end to make P3 easier. Points of Improvement \u2b25 Try to time the ability you use to break tendrils with to ensure Telos doesn't heal. \u2b25 Make magic onslaught as short as possible, by dragging Telos out of the beam fast, and ensuring you block the beam as soon as magic onslaught starts, if it's on Telos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Phasing P1 after tendrils can help with this as it gives Magical Onslaught first spec, which means the spec bar won't have charged much at all, however it is not worth delaying P1 for this. Phase 3 Strategy \u2b25 Run to corner at start then surge to beam once it spawns. Use Onslaught once you get in beam (make sure you're between Telos and the origin of the beam so he won't walk). \u2b25 Camp Soul Split on this phase. Use \u200e \u200eDeflect Mage during Onslaught as doesn't work with it. You can also put Deflect Melee on when Hold Still is near to give you more safety. \u2b25 Dreadnips can lead to Telos getting stuck in a place where you can't hit him while stood in the beam, or can lead to him getting stuck in the beam, so for this reason it is advised to wait until you are in the beam before deploying one. \u2b25 Once the 3rd minion spawns, use a bleed on one of the existing minions to kill it. Try to make sure there's no more than 2 minions alive at any point. \u2b25 Keep your HP up and focus on making sure you're ready to deal with Hold Still when it comes. \u2b25 If you feel overwhelmed, return to the corner in order to ensure Telos isn't stood in a red beam. Points of Improvement \u2b25 Can use Metamorphosis instead of Onslaught if you have Limitless sigil unlocked. This can lead to a faster phase time but requires more skill. \u2b25 Spend more time in red beam to ensure you do more damage to Telos. \u2b25 When Telos is close to phase HP, if the spec bar is low enough you can focus on killing him rather than killing minions. Phase 4 The above image shows the location where you drop down (X) and the 3 fonts, labeled in order. Between each section of this phase you should begin to move towards the next font. This lets you move into it faster and avoid any unnecessary So Much Powers (SMPs). Drop down \u2b25 Focus on stunning Telos and building enough adren to be able to reflect in the first font. Re-apply debuffs if necessary. \u2b25 Camp Soul Split for the entire phase (you can use Deflect Melee when golems are attacking if necessary). \u2b25 You can use a \u200e \u200eDreadnips on this phase, however it can lead to Telos phasing at bad times. \u2b25 Deal with specs appropriately, make sure you don't phase Telos immediately before Hold Still as you need your defensives off cooldown in order to deal with this spec properly. \u2b25 Once Telos is at the phase hp, before equipping your spirit shield try to use Corruption Blast /Corruption Shot on the red minion that spawns. Then equip Spirit shield , use Reflect and run into the font. Continue to AoE minions as much as possible: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If ranging, use chins and good basics to build adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If meleeing, can use AoEs like Hurricane / Quake /Cleave/Flurry before reflecting. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you're struggling to kill minions by the time the font has charged, you can skip the Reflect and use your regular 2h/dw weapons to kill them faster. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can also use resonance or divert on the font, however when learning this isn't recommended due to the likelihood of needing these to deal with specs. After 1st Font \u2b25 When the font finishes charging + minions are dead, check the spec bar to ensure it isn't full. If it is full, you were too slow to get into the font and So Much Power will replace the next spec. \u2b25 Assuming the spec bar is not full, focus Telos and DPS as normal. \u2b25 It's important at this stage to try to phase Telos into the 2nd font immediately after a spec, to ensure you can deal with SMP appropriately. \u2b25 When Telos is phased, deal with minions in the same way as you did with the first font. Corruption Blast /Corruption Shot red minion, then Reflect and run into font before AoEing them to kill them. After 2nd Font \u2b25 This is by far the most important time in the entire fight to stun Telos, as it lets your defensives come off cooldown in order to deal with So Much Power properly. \u2b25 Make sure you are full HP in case you make a mistake dealing with SMP. \u2b25 DPS as normal, once again making sure you don't phase immediately before Hold Still. \u2b25 When Telos is phased, deal with minions in the same way as you did with the other two fonts. Corruption Blast / Corruption Shot red minion, then Reflect and run into font before AoEing them to kill them. After 3rd Font \u2b25 When the font finishes charging + minions are dead, check the spec bar to ensure it isn't full. If it is full, you were too slow to get into the font and So Much Power will replace the next spec. \u2b25 Assuming the spec bar is not full, focus Telos and DPS as normal until Telos' HP hits 0 (hopefully before yours). Congratulations on the kill if its below 100% enrage! Points of Improvement \u2b25 Charge Detonate or stall an ability on Telos before he releases the instakill. If melee, try to kill the minions early enough to allow you to use barge on Telos and bleed destroy after every font. \u2b25 Can use Revenge with a Defender to give you more damage on minions + Telos. \u2b25 If you are still targeting Telos when he becomes untargetable, you will lose your target and therefore be able to use defensive thresholds (like Reflect / Revenge / Devotion ) without losing adrenaline. \u2b25 Spend less time before running into the font, optionally skipping Corruption Blast /Corruption Shot before going in. This just has the potential to speed up the phase. Phase 5 Phase 5 uses the same arena as P4. You drop down on the south side (close to where you finished the last font). Strategy \u2b25 Retarget Telos at the start and run to the green beam wherever it spawns (you should pre-run towards the left beam until you can see where the green beam has spawned). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Aim to stand 1-3 squares away from Telos on side-beam, or 4 squares away on back-beam. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not surge to backbeam as this can make minions go around both sides of Telos, causing them to group up poorly. \u2b25 Use a Vulnerability bomb at a convenient time. These only work when thrown at any square md of Telos, on the East side, South side, or the West side of Telos. For this reason it's strongly advised to throw it at the start. \u2b25 Use Guthix staff / Quake on Telos as early as possible. \u2b25 Use Dreadnips as early as possible and reapply throughout the phase, when necessary. \u2b25 You can likely camp Soul Split for much of this phase, though Deflect Melee when minions are attacking you is recommended. \u2b25 Sunshine / Death's Swiftness as soon as you get in green beam and focus on stunning Telos. \u2b25 When minions have grouped up: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If maging, use Tsunami on golems (try to hit them all). Use Corruption Blast or other AoEs to kill any stragglers that your Tsunami missed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If ranging, use Chins + regular good abilities to kill golems (e.g. Snap Shot , or Dark bow EoF if you have it). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If meleeing, equip Laniakea spear and use Meteor Strike + Hurricane / Quake if necessary. \u2b25 Use Vitality potion for rockfall if off cooldown, or just Reflect . \u2b25 Spam Guthix staff or Dark bow EoF or just use good abilities until virus spawns. (If you are camping a 2h weapon you can only use these every other ability. If using dw you can use them every gcd). Clear virus then wait for beam swap. \u2b25 Return to green beam and wait for the first rockfall. Dodge this then use Onslaught . \u2b25 If Telos charges instakill, build to 100% adrenaline in the green beam and use Immortality . Build to 100% adrenaline again and reapply debuffs. Try not to be stood near the green beam when the next set of minions spawn as this will make grouping them up harder. \u2b25 After instakill, run to green beam and repeat. Points of Improvement \u2b25 Apply debuffs earlier. \u2b25 Stand MD of Telos for Tsunami so it hits him too. This is only relevant on side-beams. \u2b25 Learn the Surges (from backbeam, or to backbeam) to clear virus and move between beams faster. You can do this by surging while targeting Telos on sidebeam (assuming you're stood within the 3 squares closest to him). From backbeam, you should run diagonally towards a sidebeam and surge when you are 2 squares away from Telos. \u2b25 If confident, can tank a rockfall at lower enrages to prolong Onslaught . \u2b25 At much lower enrages, if you have non-red minions you can just Onslaught as soon as you get to green beam and Telos should die before virus. This may require some prayer flicking. Looting Introduction \u2b25 The drop rate of uniques is influenced by both enrage and streak length. Common drops aren't influenced by enrage but they are hugely influenced by streak length. \u2b25 Luck of the Dwarves can rarely increase the quantity of a common drop, or reroll a common drop into a unique. This is infrequent so it's not usually worth checking after every kill, but on streaks it is advised to check at the end of every aura. Loot Tiers Telos has 3 loot tiers depending on your enrage: \u2b25 Bronze Loot tier: <25% enrage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 30 times reduced unique drop rate \u2b25 Silver Loot tier: 25-99% enrage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 10 times reduced unique drop rate \u2b25 Gold Loot tier: 100%+ enrage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Regular unique drop rate","title":"Telos beginner"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-beginner/#telos-beginner","text":"Beginner Telos (Courtesy of #Wh)","title":"Telos beginner"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-beginner/#introduction","text":"This guide is targeted towards people who have never been to the boss before.

As this guide is intentionally non-specific with respect to exact rotations, you can downgrade/upgrade gear wherever necessary, including changing the ratio of Sailfish / Blue Blubber Jellyfish / Saradomin Brew , or bringing fewer Super Restores . \u2b25 Some of these presets do not include a Ring of Death . Due to prices constantly fluctuating and these presets being quite flexible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It's strongly recommended to compare your death cost with a standard DPS ring to the cost of death with a Ring of Death (currently 1,084,119). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make sure to also include the cost of your familiar and any supplies kept inside. \u2b25 A Pack Mammoth is used to ensure survivability, with the expectation that you will tank some specs just by virtue of being unfamiliar with the boss. This can be downgraded to whatever your best Beast of Burden is. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Mammoth scrolls allows your Mammoth to consume food without you losing adren, and will only consume Sailfish , so this should be used throughout the fight. This can also be used alongside regular eating, allowing you to heal a considerable amount in 1 tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When you are confident with specs you can switch this for a Ripper demon . \u2b25 Some regular Sailfish are included in the inventory to allow you to overheal to reduce the chance of death when tanking a high hit. \u2b25 Bladed Dive is strongly recommended to help with mobility including getting into beams to clear virus, as well as moving around on both P4 and P5. \u2b25 Spirit shields are used for their 30% damage reduction - greatly improving survivability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Any regular shield (the higher tier the better) will also work though. \u2b25 Expensive Spices are brought to boost the healing of Sailfish and Blue Blubber Jellyfish by 50 hp. This is not a requirement but can be useful. \u2b25 As this is a beginner guide with accessibility prioritised, it is assumed you won't DW + 2h swap (beyond applying Black Stone Arrows with Ranged). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However doing so will obviously help with damage output. Magic \u2b25 This magic preset uses an Inquisitor's Staff due to it being specifically good against Telos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can be downgraded to a Noxious Staff or equivalent. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Similarly dual-wield magic is more than good enough. \u2b25 The Seismic Wand in this preset has Planted Feet on it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It's useful to have this on a high tier weapon as it is used to kill minions on P4 with a shield equipped, but this can still be downgraded to a Wand of the Cywir Elders or even Virtus Wand if necessary. \u2b25 Rune Pouch : \u2b25 Rune Pouch : \u2b25 Rune Pouch : \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 These give access to Blood spells Blood Barrage (for healing), Ice spells (for binding minions), Spellbook Swap , Disruption Shield , Vengeance and Shield Dome .

They will also be applied on Phase 5. If you wish to avoid using extra arrows you can consider bringing Araxyte arrows as a switch. \u2b25 Mechanised chinchompa are used along with an off-hand Shadow glaive to AoE minions during fonts on P4, and on P5. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The off-hand Shadow glaive is not required, but strongly recommended. \u2b25 The Stalker's ring is used as it gives 3% crit bonus while using a bow.

Phase 5 has 100k HP at 100% enrage (scaling up to 200k HP at 300% enrage). \u2b25 The spec order carries across phases, with the colour of the first spec in the next phase corresponding to the same colour of the last spec in the previous phase. For example, if your last spec on P1 was Tendrils (green), the first spec on P2 will be onslaught. The yellow boxes also go to Charge on p3. \u2b25 There are 3 autos between every spec on Phases 1-4. This number of autos does not reset between p1 and p2, but it does at the end of every other phase. \u2b25 Phase 1 starts with 7 autos before the first spec. \u2b25 Phase 3 starts with 7 autos before the first spec (10 autos if the last spec on P2 was hold still, virus, or uppercut). \u2b25 Phase 5 has 10 autos before virus, and 17 autos between virus and instakill. It is not usually necessary to count these autos though. Phase Overview \u2b25 Phase 1: A green beam will spawn sporadically, gbiving 10% adrenaline per tick when you stand in it. This bar will also charge Telos' spec bar until he uses a \"So Much Power\" special attack, if he's stood in the beam. Telos will primarily deal melee attacks on this phase, only resorting to mage when you are far away. \u2b25 Phase 2: A Black beam will consistently spawn on Telos charging his spec bar. This beam changes locations every 20 seconds. The Magic Onslaught special will drain this spec bar and will continue until the spec bar is empty. Telos will primarily deal melee attacks on this phase, only resorting to mage when you are far away. \u2b25 Phase 3: A Red beam will consistently spawn in a semi-random location. This increases the damage you deal (and take) while stood in the beam. If Telos is stood in the beam, his spec bar will be charged which can lead to you getting nuked by Telos if it makes it onto the red right side. If it is on the red left side of the spec bar, your adrenaline and prayer will get drained occasionally. Three golems will also spawn, one at a time, as the phase progresses. If killed, they will respawn after a certain amount of time. Telos will only deal mage autos on this phase. \u2b25 Phase 4: Every 1/4 of phase hp, Telos will become untargetable and charge an instakill while you charge a font by standing close to it. The font will hit you 5 times, after which the font hp will hit 0 and the font will spawn an anima shield. Telos will release the instakill and you stand close to the font to avoid getting killed. When the instakill is released your defensives get put on cooldown for 6s. Telos will primarily deal melee attacks on this phase, only resorting to mage when you are far away. \u2b25 Phase 5: (100%+ enr only) All three beams spawn on Telos in a random arrangement. The beams swap places every 36 seconds. Telos charges an instakill throughout this phase. The green beam will speed up Telos' autos so it's important to block it as much as possible. Telos will only deal mage autos on this phase.","title":"Overview of the Fight"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-beginner/#mechanics","text":"Tendrils \u2b25 This spec will bind you in place and drain your hp and adrenaline until you do a certain amount of damage (3000 + 10 \u00d7 Enrage). \u2b25 No need to anticipate this, just react to it and use a strong ability like Guthix staff / Snap Shot / Greater Ricochet / Hurricane Uppercut (Charge) \u2b25 Telos will lift his arm and charge an uppercut towards you, dealing damage when he releases it. \u2b25 You can avoid all damage by using Surge / Escape / Bladed Dive and travelling at least 3 squares. The correct time to do this is 1 tick after you see Telos' overhead text disappear. \u2b25 Resonance will work to negate this damage, but it's generally a low amount of damage so worth trying to learn the correct timing. \u2b25 No need to anticipate this, just react to it and learn when to Surge / Escape / Bladed Dive . Hold Still (Stun) \u2b25 Telos will hit you with one small auto, followed by a large melee hit which will bind and stun you if you don't have Anticipate / Freedom up. Telos will then jump on the location where you stood when you took the large melee hit, dealing a 5x5 AoE attack and blocking you from using overhead prayers for a short time. You can walk away to avoid this. \u2b25 The small auto counts towards the 3 autos till next spec, so there will only be 2 further autos before the next spec. \u2b25 By far the most important spec to learn. Need to anticipate it and use Anticipate / Freedom in advance, then Resonance after you get hit with the small auto (which can splash) to res the large hit, this is important for both healing and damage mitigation. \u2b25 While learning it's advised you camp melee prayer for this. You can also use Devotion + Deflect Melee if not confident using Resonance to completely negate the melee hit. You will still need to Anticipate / Freedom though. \u2b25 If you forget to Anticipate / Freedom , you can click your shield from inventory and spam Resonance in order to negate the hit splat from the jump. Magical Onslaught \u2b25 The black beam will fill Telos' anima as long as he's standing on the beam. Once this special attack comes, he will fire gradually stronger Magic auto-attacks until the bar is depleted. \u2b25 Telos will become immobilised during this special so it's important you block the beam by standing in it because you won't be able to walk him out of the beam. Virus \u2b25 This only occurs at 50%+ enrage. \u2b25 This attack deals a small amount of damage every tick, until you stand in the beam. \u2b25 No need to anticipate this, just move to beam when you notice it. \u2b25 You can use Reflect / Debilitate to reduce this but this is not worthwhile. Green virus, phase 5 only Black virus, phase 2 and 5 Red virus, phase 3 and 5 Shockwaves \u2b25 Rapid, hard hitting typeless hit used by Telos if he's overcharged by the Red Beam and the mini-golems in Phase 3. Shockwaves unleashed Drain \u2b25 Telos drains your adrenaline and prayer to charge his anima, used if his anima is over the left red bar on Phase 3. Phase 4 Fonts \u2b25 Once Telos hits a fourth of his health, he will kneel down and absorb the anima from the Pure \u2192 Volcanic \u2192 Corrupt font. Also spawning a Golem of each anima type with varying effects: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Pure anima-golem (green) Golem hits increasingly harder the longer he's left alive. (Currently bugged and deals very low melee hits) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Volcanic anima-golem (red) golem periodically stuns you with his attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Corrupted anima-golem (black) golem shreds your armour, reducing your defences. \u2b25 The font has an area of 6x6 (the font object is 2x2, but you can stand in a 2 square radius outside of this). Standing in the font will deal damage to you 5 times, until the font runs out of HP, at which point it will create an Anima shield of the same size. Once the font is fully charged, or if it is ignored for too long, he will launch the instakill, killing you unless you are stood inside the Anima shield. Weak Anima Bomb \u2b25 Telos will fire a large slow-moving orb towards you that will hit for reasonably high damage. \u2b25 This attack turns you green and does constant damage and drains Overload timers until you stand in one of the fonts. \u2b25 Don't massively need to anticipate this - make sure you run to a font as Telos releases it. \u2b25 All defensives work on this, though Resonance will not heal you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Recommended to use Shield Dome / Resonance / Disruption Shield (if not saving it for So Much Power). So Much Power! (SMP) \u2b25 When Telos' spec bar is full on Phase 4 (also on Phase 1, though this is unlikely), his next spec will be replaced by this. He will say \"SO. MUCH. POWER!\" and fire one small auto, then one very hard hitting typeless hit. This small auto counts towards the 3 autos till next spec. \u2b25 It is not advised to tank this spec without the use of defensives or Vitality potion . \u2b25 By far the most important part of P4 because it frequently happens soon after he fires his instakill at a font, and hence your defensives will be on cooldown. For this reason, you should try to phase Telos into a font immediately after a spec, in order to give you 3 autos for your defensives to come off cooldown. \u2b25 Aim to Devotion + Resonance where possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Aim to be within melee distance of Telos for this so you can use Deflect Melee and devotion will stop your res sniped by Telos or any minions that may be alive. If you are going to get a mage auto, ensure you aren't close to any minions and Deflect Mage will be sufficient. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you can't Devotion + Resonance , use Vitality potion + Resonance / Disruption Shield out of distance of minions. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Shield Dome and vitality pot should also be used as a last resort. Rockfall \u2b25 Below 1,000% enrage, Telos periodically drops a single rock on P5 which deals heavy typeless damage if stood in a 5x5 area around the rockfall. Phase 5 Instakill \u2b25 Telos will charge this instakill with every auto on P5. When Telos finishes charging it, he will stop attacking and raise both arms. After it is released the bar progress is reset and this spec repeats. \u2b25 This instakill can be negated by using the Immortality ability, or charging a font (kill 4 golems next to their respective font) though this is impractical and generally avoided.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-beginner/#phase-1","text":"Strategy \u2b25 Planted feet Sunshine start.

Then equip Spirit shield , use Reflect and run into the font. Continue to AoE minions as much as possible: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If ranging, use chins and good basics to build adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If meleeing, can use AoEs like Hurricane / Quake /Cleave/Flurry before reflecting. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you're struggling to kill minions by the time the font has charged, you can skip the Reflect and use your regular 2h/dw weapons to kill them faster. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can also use resonance or divert on the font, however when learning this isn't recommended due to the likelihood of needing these to deal with specs.

Try not to be stood near the green beam when the next set of minions spawn as this will make grouping them up harder. \u2b25 After instakill, run to green beam and repeat. Points of Improvement \u2b25 Apply debuffs earlier. \u2b25 Stand MD of Telos for Tsunami so it hits him too. This is only relevant on side-beams. \u2b25 Learn the Surges (from backbeam, or to backbeam) to clear virus and move between beams faster. You can do this by surging while targeting Telos on sidebeam (assuming you're stood within the 3 squares closest to him). From backbeam, you should run diagonally towards a sidebeam and surge when you are 2 squares away from Telos. \u2b25 If confident, can tank a rockfall at lower enrages to prolong Onslaught . \u2b25 At much lower enrages, if you have non-red minions you can just Onslaught as soon as you get to green beam and Telos should die before virus.

The big objectives are to block and reduce as much damage as possible without using many defensives and to apply a Barge bleed + Hurricane on tendrils perfectly. Random defensive + two ticks after \u2192 \u2192 target cycle + + \u2192 [ if you get a Relentless proc on ] \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 [Skip if you got a Relentless proc] \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 s \u2192 r + \u2192 If your Divert splashes completely, just use an adrenaline renewal . Divert also works much better at higher enrages, but it's still good enough for lower enrages above 500% or so. This lets you save your adrenaline renewal for emergencies if it works out. Take off your platebody for a better chance of Divert working. That stalled Assault is important so you line up two Assault hits and Hurricane all on top of each other for tendrils, nearly guaranteeing an instant free or a tick-late free even past 2700% enrage. This is less important at lower enrages and you don't need to stall at lower enrages, but if you want to do enrages above 2000% it is highly recommended you learn how to do it. During the Cleave and Decimate after the initial Berserk , you should be running out of range to bait out Telos\u2019s Magic attacks. This is super important because Telos\u2019s Magic attacks hit far less than his Melee attacks, which makes it much easier to survive when under Berserk , especially as you approach 4000%. After the Cleave after Hurricane , it depends entirely on how much LP Telos has. If he hits 450k right after Cleave , wait until the tick Telos phases, then use Quake + Bladed Dive to the drop-off point. That Quake is important because it lets you carry over that damage to the next phase immediately, giving you a noticeable headstart for P2. This works because AoE abilities like Quake , Bombardment , and Chain calculate their damage late enough to be forced into the next phase if you use them on the same tick as phasing to the next phase. Practically speaking, only Quake can be used like this as Cleave hits too quickly. If Telos is not immediately phased after that Cleave , do strong basics like Decimate and Sever to get it down before uppercut happens, then Quake prephase if it lines up nicely. If you do get uppercut, phase him immediately after and prephase with a Quake . Phase 2 The start of P2 depends on how many autoattacks Telos has before Onslaught and how much adrenaline you have going into P2. If you have over 77% adrenaline, you will want to ZGS spec before bleeding Greater Flurry . Otherwise, reverse that order. If 2 autos before Onslaught at 77%+ adren: Wait a tick \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 bleed + same tick \u2192 s + back into ZGS spec \u2192 r + + throw right as Telos autos \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k \u2192 prephase If 2 autos before Onslaught under 77% adren: Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 bleed \u2192 \u2192 + same tick \u2192 s + back into ZGS spec \u2192 r + + throw right as Telos autos \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k \u2192 prephase Waiting that one tick before Barge is extremely important, because if you just Barge instantly you will deal no damage. So wait a tick for that damage immunity to pass by. An easy way to time this is to spam click a , then Barge immediately after you see your prayer points be restored. The Escape and Bladed Dive back in are done to ensure Telos leaves the black beam with zero RNG. It must be perfectly done on the same tick as your other ability though, as anything less than perfect play like being late will cause the lure to fail and you will have to end up blocking the black beam. Focus on getting the Escape , as the Bladed Dive back is far more lenient. If 0-1 autos before Onslaught at 77%+ adren: Wait a tick \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + drag Telos out of the beam \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k \u2192 prephase If 0-1 autos before Onslaught under 77% adren: Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + drag Telos out of the beam \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k \u2192 prephase Try to get Assault in as early as possible, and try to aim to phase before Hold Still as well if you can. If after uppercut on P1 OR no ZGS: Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 + walk \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics and thresholds until 300k \u2192 prephase Ideally you should not get this, but the above rotation deals with it correctly. If you don't have a ZGS, just use more basics between Assault and Freedom . The autoattack with 2h after Destroy is known as \u201c5TAA\u201d, or \u201c5T\u201d for short. Basically, after a dual wield ability, you can switch to your 2h weapon and force out a quick autoattack two ticks after that ability. Because of the stun duration, this 5T wastes just enough time yet still gains damage to allow for the longest stun duration from a bled Destroy to Backhand to Forceful Backhand . This will get used in both P3 and P4, so even if you don\u2019t get uppercut on P1 to force this rotation, it\u2019s worth learning this. Phase 3 The goal in Phase 3 is to burst down Telos as quickly and consistently as possible. Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 + into the beam \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics to 150k You don\u2019t necessarily need to Quake prephase here because P4 is somewhat time-locked anyway, but it's helpful to. If you don\u2019t have enough adrenaline to fit in both Blood Tendrils and Slaughter before Assault, just skip Blood Tendrils and do some basics instead. In order to make P4 better at higher enrages so you aren\u2019t scrambling for adrenaline, you can lure Telos into the beam and balance the bar. That way, when Telos drains you right after Assault , it won't completely deplete your adrenaline. Should the beam spawn on Telos, do this conservatively, else you will have to delay your Assault by one ability so you can use Disruption Shield on the explosion losslessly. Phase 4 The goal here is to do as much damage as possible to Telos before he can fire off any special attacks, so rocks are completely skipped. Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 \u2192 Use Limitless here if you can. If your adrenaline is really dire, skip Statius\u2019s warhammer and Quake instead. For font 1, Resonance + Reflect and build to 100% adrenaline. Wait for the chatbox message \u201cTelos: You dare to defy me?\u201d and throw a sticky bomb on the golems right when that happens. Get out of range from the golems, then Barge Telos right as he gets up and throws the instant-kill. Safe Rotation (0 Telos autos): Telos + run back to font \u2192 \u2192 wait 2 ticks, (5taa if possible) + \u2192 \u2192 or if you missed it earlier Fast Rotation (1 Telos auto): Telos + run back to font \u2192 \u2192 3 hit \u2192 or or if you missed it earlier Safest Rotation (1-2 Telos autos depending on Barge timing): Telos right as the instant-kill lands \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5taa) + \u2192 \u2192 or or if you missed it earlier For this safest rotation, you need to use Barge perfectly on tick, otherwise you will either get instant-killed or you will get two Telos autos. In addition, if sub-1000% and you didn't pop Freedom, immediately bleed Destroy and skip Decimate . For font 2, do the same thing except you\u2019re tanking everything here, so be prepared to eat up a lot. This time, use Revenge with defender . Skip Revenge if you are not using a defender . Use the same cues as in font 1 and go to town. You can use Devotion here to mitigate damage, but if you\u2019re going for fast font 3, skip that. After second instant-kill, Telos right as the instant-kill lands. This always pops Telos\u2019s Freedom immediately at 1000%+, delaying his next action. Bleed \u2192 3 hit \u2192 for safety, otherwise just use a basic for more adrenaline if you are confident in your DPS. Below 1000%, his Freedom may not be back on time, so you can skip bleeding Greater Flurry and just bleed Destroy immediately. Safe Font 3: After Telos phases into font 3, turn the corner around the middle beam area and wait for all the golems to line up single-file. Bladed Dive over to the end of the group of three golems and use Ingenuity of the Humans + Entangle on the closest golem. This traps all golems behind that one golem for 24 seconds, which is more than enough to deal with Telos himself. Resonance and Reflect the font, then ZGS spec + adrenaline potion . Barge him with Mobile , then stall a Cleave . Release the Cleave two ticks after the message \u201cTelos is preparing to fire an anima bomb!\u201d and bleed Assault right after. Follow that up with either Destroy (since it can stun out of range), or Backhand \u2192 Cleave or Destroy and finish the job there. Alternatively, just bleed Destroy right after instant-kill, 5taa to Backhand then Forceful Backhand . Fast Font 3 (very dangerous!): Immediately head into font 3 and start eating up while using Resonance + Reflect . Right at the end of the font, use Devotion and lure the golems away from Telos. Sticky bomb them OR use Ingenuity of the Humans + Corruption Shot with bolas and Barge Telos with Mobile \u2192 Assault \u2192 Destroy \u2192 basics until dead while keeping minions at bay with more sticky bombs. Extremely dangerous however, and not recommended unless you are very confident. Phase 5 Make sure you have Disruption Shield active and are praying Melee at the start of the phase. If you do the rest of this phase perfectly, Telos and golems cannot KO you at the start of the phase no matter what, as Disruption Shield will always prioritize blocking Telos's Magic attack. Make sure you you click on Telos with your mouse while doing defensives before , as you gain lossless autos. These autos may add up in damage helping to clear post virus / on virus clear much easier. Also remember to click away from telos at least 4.8 seconds (8 ticks) before using , otherwise you'd lose bleed buff.

If you want to further play it safe and/or you want to ensure you will always be able to kill Telos even after you clear virus, you can use Immortality OR dragon battleaxe instead of Berserk and simply replace the first dragon claw spec with Berserk . Newcomers to this enrage/rotation should start with either Immortality or dragon battleaxe first, only using Berserk in the above rotation if you're confident in surviving. Side Beam, Volcanic Golems (1000%+) Wait 2 ticks after regaining control \u2192 Mobile Barge Telos right as the message \u201cKill the anima-golems at the correct font to charge it!\u201d appears \u2192 or or if you need adrenaline + into the green beam \u2192 OR \u2192 OR \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 + into the beam away from Telos \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + to block golems preemptively \u2192 + preemptively \u2192 + + two ticks after using it into the virus/red beam \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics to 0 LP if somehow not dead Back Beam, Volcanic Golems (1000%+) Wait 2 ticks after regaining control \u2192 Mobile Barge Telos right as the message \u201cKill the anima-golems at the correct font to charge it!\u201d appears \u2192 or or if you need adrenaline + as close as possible to the back beam on the left side \u2192 \u2192 stall + release on Telos within the beam \u2192 OR \u2192 OR \u2192 \u2192 + into the beam away from Telos \u2192 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + to block golems preemptively \u2192 + preemptively \u2192 + two ticks after using it into the virus/red beam \u2192 \u2192 dragon claw spec \u2192 basics to 0 LP if somehow not dead These have zero RNG with getting stunned at inopportune times. The only risk is a potential rock before Barricade , but that\u2019s very rare. You can also afford to swap Statius\u2019s warhammer with Freedom on side beam for that bit of extra safety if volcanics took their time to start hitting you at the start. And as before, if you are not confident with volcanics out there, you can simply use Immortality or dragon battleaxe instead of Berserk , which is even more advised to use over Berserk . It\u2019s also a near necessity to wait those two ticks before Barge as well and nail the timing. If you Barge too early, golems can surround you when inside the beam and it can hurt far more, and if you Barge too late your Disruption Shield can no longer guarantee you not getting KOed at the start. Sticky Bomb Guide for Phase 4/5 Phase 4 General Notes \u2b25 Sticky bombs take 3 ticks to land when thrown, and creates a 3x3 area that will make bindable/stunnable enemies get stuck. \u2b25 Phase Telos to hp cap then run into the appropriate font. \u2b25 Once font is depleted click on sticky bomb and use the right click option on middle golem. Don't drop sticky yet. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throw the first sticky bomb when you get the popup message You dare defy me? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throw the second sticky bomb directly beyond the first sticky bomb when you get the popup message Telos is preparing to fire an anima bomb! \u2b25 When you barge and start damaging telos, put yourself in a direct line beyond the minions and the sticky bombs so they stay in line and run into the next sticky bomb rather than dispersing and running around the bomb. Note: there are pre-barge and non pre-barge strategies to damage telos between fonts. This section will have examples showing pre-barge. Font 1 \u2b25 Starting in the font, you will place sticky bombs as shown, then simply barge telos and do damage until he reaches the next hp cap to trigger the 2nd font. \u2b25 Font 1 sticky bomb example: Font 2 \u2b25 Starting at the red circle drawn in this picture, you will run down to the corner near the font and do a couple defensives while waiting to enter the font. Once minions stack up near you, you can enter the font and they will be nicely stacked 2-3 golems wide. Rushing into the font can cause golems to be 4 units wide which makes it so one of them cannot be trapped by a sticky bomb. \u2b25 Font 2 sticky bomb example: Note: The player did a faster font 2 method where they went straight into the font, then ran out to the waiting spot to line up minions, and then back in. The safest way is to go directly to the wait spot and let minions stack there. Font 3 \u2b25 The safest strategy for font 3 is to utilize the wrap-around method, so starting at the red circle drawn in this picture, you will follow the pathing of the red arrows and throw a sticky bomb. \u2b25 Starting at the red circle in this picture, damage Telos until he reaches 37,500 hp, then throw a sticky bomb and follow the pathing indicated in this picture: \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The sticky bomb here makes it so the golems get stuck and cannot hit you while you wait for the font 3 golems to line up in front of you. \u2b25 Hug the right-hand wall of the giant anima pool in that picture and wait for font 3 golems to get in front of you, then bladed dive behind the last golem in line. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After you bladed dive, target cycle Ingenuity of the Humans Entangle (either via borrowed power or spellbook swap) the last golem in line, then enter the third font. The minions should be stuck there long enough for you to finish Phase 4. \u2b25 Font 3 Wrap around method: Phase 5 General Notes \u2b25 The timing for sticky bombs on Phase 5 are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sticky #1: when you bleed assault \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sticky #2: when you do your 3rd claw special (2nd to last ability before changing beams/clearing virus) \u2b25 If Telos still has a good amount of hp left when you clear virus, keep throwing sticky bombs between where you are and where minions will be running to in order to permanently have them stuck while you finish the phase. Backbeam Green \u2b25 You want to throw the sticky bomb to the side of telos before using the last claws ability. \u2b25 You want to bladed dive to the appropriate side beam during the global cooldown after your last claws special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bladed diving 2 ticks after activating your last claws special attack lets you fully channel the special attack, and will allow you to immediately use your next ability rather than being stuck waiting for the global cooldown to finish. \u2b25 Back beam to side beam example with red virus: Sidebeam Green With Either Back or Opposite Side Beam Virus \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are confident in yourself you can wait to see what virus you got and decide to skip one of the bombs depending on whether you need to go to back beam or side beam, but it is good practice to do both bombs to be safe. \u2b25 Side beam to back beam example:","title":"Telos melee"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-melee/#telos-melee","text":"","title":"Telos melee"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-melee/#telos-with-melee-courtesy-of-evil-lucario","text":"","title":"Telos with Melee (Courtesy of #Evil Lucario)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-melee/#introduction","text":"Why Melee?

That stalled Assault is important so you line up two Assault hits and Hurricane all on top of each other for tendrils, nearly guaranteeing an instant free or a tick-late free even past 2700% enrage. This is less important at lower enrages and you don't need to stall at lower enrages, but if you want to do enrages above 2000% it is highly recommended you learn how to do it. During the Cleave and Decimate after the initial Berserk , you should be running out of range to bait out Telos\u2019s Magic attacks. This is super important because Telos\u2019s Magic attacks hit far less than his Melee attacks, which makes it much easier to survive when under Berserk , especially as you approach 4000%. After the Cleave after Hurricane , it depends entirely on how much LP Telos has. If he hits 450k right after Cleave , wait until the tick Telos phases, then use Quake + Bladed Dive to the drop-off point. That Quake is important because it lets you carry over that damage to the next phase immediately, giving you a noticeable headstart for P2. This works because AoE abilities like Quake , Bombardment , and Chain calculate their damage late enough to be forced into the next phase if you use them on the same tick as phasing to the next phase. Practically speaking, only Quake can be used like this as Cleave hits too quickly. If Telos is not immediately phased after that Cleave , do strong basics like Decimate and Sever to get it down before uppercut happens, then Quake prephase if it lines up nicely.

If you don't have a ZGS, just use more basics between Assault and Freedom . The autoattack with 2h after Destroy is known as \u201c5TAA\u201d, or \u201c5T\u201d for short. Basically, after a dual wield ability, you can switch to your 2h weapon and force out a quick autoattack two ticks after that ability. Because of the stun duration, this 5T wastes just enough time yet still gains damage to allow for the longest stun duration from a bled Destroy to Backhand to Forceful Backhand . This will get used in both P3 and P4, so even if you don\u2019t get uppercut on P1 to force this rotation, it\u2019s worth learning this.","title":"Phase 2"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-melee/#phase-3","text":"The goal in Phase 3 is to burst down Telos as quickly and consistently as possible.

In order to make P4 better at higher enrages so you aren\u2019t scrambling for adrenaline, you can lure Telos into the beam and balance the bar. That way, when Telos drains you right after Assault , it won't completely deplete your adrenaline.

Safe Font 3: After Telos phases into font 3, turn the corner around the middle beam area and wait for all the golems to line up single-file. Bladed Dive over to the end of the group of three golems and use Ingenuity of the Humans + Entangle on the closest golem.

Barge him with Mobile , then stall a Cleave . Release the Cleave two ticks after the message \u201cTelos is preparing to fire an anima bomb!\u201d and bleed Assault right after.

Note: there are pre-barge and non pre-barge strategies to damage telos between fonts. This section will have examples showing pre-barge. Font 1 \u2b25 Starting in the font, you will place sticky bombs as shown, then simply barge telos and do damage until he reaches the next hp cap to trigger the 2nd font. \u2b25 Font 1 sticky bomb example: Font 2 \u2b25 Starting at the red circle drawn in this picture, you will run down to the corner near the font and do a couple defensives while waiting to enter the font. Once minions stack up near you, you can enter the font and they will be nicely stacked 2-3 golems wide. Rushing into the font can cause golems to be 4 units wide which makes it so one of them cannot be trapped by a sticky bomb. \u2b25 Font 2 sticky bomb example: Note: The player did a faster font 2 method where they went straight into the font, then ran out to the waiting spot to line up minions, and then back in. The safest way is to go directly to the wait spot and let minions stack there. Font 3 \u2b25 The safest strategy for font 3 is to utilize the wrap-around method, so starting at the red circle drawn in this picture, you will follow the pathing of the red arrows and throw a sticky bomb. \u2b25 Starting at the red circle in this picture, damage Telos until he reaches 37,500 hp, then throw a sticky bomb and follow the pathing indicated in this picture: \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The sticky bomb here makes it so the golems get stuck and cannot hit you while you wait for the font 3 golems to line up in front of you. \u2b25 Hug the right-hand wall of the giant anima pool in that picture and wait for font 3 golems to get in front of you, then bladed dive behind the last golem in line. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After you bladed dive, target cycle Ingenuity of the Humans Entangle (either via borrowed power or spellbook swap) the last golem in line, then enter the third font. The minions should be stuck there long enough for you to finish Phase 4. \u2b25 Font 3 Wrap around method: Phase 5 General Notes \u2b25 The timing for sticky bombs on Phase 5 are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sticky #1: when you bleed assault \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sticky #2: when you do your 3rd claw special (2nd to last ability before changing beams/clearing virus) \u2b25 If Telos still has a good amount of hp left when you clear virus, keep throwing sticky bombs between where you are and where minions will be running to in order to permanently have them stuck while you finish the phase. Backbeam Green \u2b25 You want to throw the sticky bomb to the side of telos before using the last claws ability. \u2b25 You want to bladed dive to the appropriate side beam during the global cooldown after your last claws special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bladed diving 2 ticks after activating your last claws special attack lets you fully channel the special attack, and will allow you to immediately use your next ability rather than being stuck waiting for the global cooldown to finish. \u2b25 Back beam to side beam example with red virus: Sidebeam Green With Either Back or Opposite Side Beam Virus \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you are confident in yourself you can wait to see what virus you got and decide to skip one of the bombs depending on whether you need to go to back beam or side beam, but it is good practice to do both bombs to be safe. \u2b25 Side beam to back beam example:","title":"Sticky Bomb Guide for Phase 4/5"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-ranged/","text":"Telos ranged Telos with Ranged (Courtesy of #Evil Lucario) Introduction Ranged Telos is by far the most difficult, and quickest way to get kills. The margin of error is much smaller, and you will require far more food usage over both Melee and Magic. Mastering this style against Telos nets you the fastest killspeeds, so it's still worth learning overall. This guide assumes you have absolute top-tier gear and preexisting knowledge of Telos. Without those two, using Ranged against Telos can only go so far for the average player. Therefore, should you want to learn Telos proper, Magic is still the best style to ease you in. This guide also works for basically every single enrage, as rotations don't change drastically across any enrage milestones like it does for Melee or Magic. An average kill at 2449% enrage is worth 15,942,553 in uniques alone. This assumes an estimated orb price of 193,723,482. Advanced players can get up to 15 kph, earning 239,138,289/hr.

You can choose to bank the Overload and simply drink it at the bank to replace it with another piece of food, but make sure you remember to do so every kill, otherwise you will be in a world of pain once it runs out. Note: As you cannot sufficiently downgrade these setups to an acceptable degree without having an extremely rough time, nearly everything listed here will be required. \u2b25 Mainhand Bladed Dive switch perked with Clear Headed 4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An armor switch with Clear Headed 4 is too much to bring. \u2b25 Bolas to bind golems on P4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As to bind a large group of enemies with Corruption Shot \u2b25 Two Essences of Finality \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 One with Dark Bow , \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 One with Seren Godbow \u2b25 A normal Seren Godbow with Black Stone arrows and Caroming 4 \u200e \u200eto drain Telos's armor, \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Statius's warhammer is not viable due to the high adrenaline costs and the lossless nature of Black Stone arrows for P1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Can be downgraded to a Noxious Longbow \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Use Decimation at your own risk. \u2b25 Eldritch crossbow is 100% needed for smooth P2, P3, and P4. \u2b25 Elysian spirit shield with Turtling 4 for damage reduction on P4 and P5 \u2b25 Ruby bolts are helpful if you know how to switch bolts properly, \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you don't want to worry about that, you can simply camp Hydrix bolts and do just fine. \u2b25 Heightened Senses , Fury of the Small , and Death Ward as relics \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Low-end Balanced Super top-end Notes \u2b25 You can even bring an Eldritch Crossbow inside another Essence of Finality for a smoother P2, P3, and P5, but this is extremely excessive so it will never be a hard requirement. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you own an Eldritch Crossbow inside an Essence of Finality , you can choose to simply use your Seren godbow as your main 2h weapon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Using an Eldritch Crossbow is still superior to use for bolt procs on P1 and P4. \u2b25 In addition, depending on you owning an Eldritch Crossbow inside an Essence of Finality , it depends on what type of thrown overrides (more details in #dpm-advice-range ) you cannot have on. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you do not have one, only use a Blowpipe override. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you do own one, only use dual wield overrides. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This will make more sense during P1 and will be elaborated on there.

Phase 2 The start of P2 depends on how many autoattacks Telos has before Onslaught and how much adrenaline you have going into P2. In this rotation, you absolutely want to at least get Rapid Fire off and skip Snap Shot if you don't have enough adrenaline. \u2b25 Both P2 and P3 can start to switch bolts depending on procs. You generally want to camp Ruby bolts , then once you get a proc you swap to Hydrix bolts for 2-3 abilities, then swap back to Ruby bolts , \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Although it's easiest to do so in the middle of Rapid Fire. \u2b25 Right before you go into the next phase though, at around 10k-20k before phasing, you'd want to camp Hydrix so you can chance for that extra bit of adrenaline. \u2b25 You also want to never use Ruby bolts with SGB spec on P2 and P3, since they can do too much \"true\" damage and cause Telos to phase too quickly by going into the next phase while still being far above the normal phase-end LP, causing extremely undesirable situations in the worst of cases.

This will spread the bind to the entire group of golems, which will let you run away from them to DPS Telos. \u2b25 Around 2.4 seconds after Corruption Shot , use Demoralise on Telos to pop his Freedom. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Look out for his message \"You dare to defy me?\" \u2b25 Four ticks after that message appears, use Snipe \u2192 Snapshot \u2192 Rout \u2192 Dark Bow to phase him into the next font immediately. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use an Adrenaline renewal immediately after to generate more adrenaline more quickly. \u2b25 If you are a bit late on Demoralise to not allow Snipe , there's a backup rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stall Snapshot on Telos, then release it a bit after the instant-kill message, then use Greater Dazing Shot immediately after releasing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Then use Rout to Dark Bow spec and use an Adrenaline renewal . Optional, quick Greater Ricochet rotation \u2b25 Stall Dark Bow , \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Wait two ticks after the message \"Telos is preparing to fire an anima bomb!\" \u2b25 Click back on Telos and use Greater Ricochet , \u2b25 Then either another Dark Bow or just use Snapshot to instantly clear him or at least come close to it. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you need safety, you can stun him with Demoralise instead of Greater Ricochet to pop Freedom, then Rout for a longer stun, then either Greater Ricochet , Snapshot , or Dark Bow to instantly phase him to font 3. Font 3 \u2b25 Resonance \u2192 Reflect again, and use Anticipation with Clear Headed 4 . \u2b25 Right as the font dies, use Devotion and make your way to under Telos again. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using Surge immediately as you get hit by the final font hit can help immensely to getting into position quickly. \u2b25 Use Corruption Shot with bolas on a golem and wait to chin SGB again. Phase 5 Make sure you have Disruption Shield active. At high enrage, you can get comboed out somewhat easily, so try to play it a bit safe until you get inside the green beam. The bulk of your DPS isn't going to come until then anyway. Note: For all enrages, use ruby bolts up until 80k LP, then switch to hydrix bolts for the rest of the phase.

This is quite risky as you climb higher and higher, so feel free to use the 1000%+ rotation instead of this hurts too much. \u2b25 If you get Volcanics, you'll need to use Anticipation with Clear Headed 4 after you see a volcanic do two autoattacks. Use Freedom right when Anticipation wears off, then finish off Telos. 1000%+ : (tc) + / + \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 spam \u2b25 You may also use this for sub-1000% if the sub-1000% rotation starts hurting too much. It's slower, but exponentially safer. \u2b25 If Telos isn't dead when Barricade is about to run out, just Surge to the virus beam and kite the minions as you do more damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build to dark bow specs and finish off Telos. \u2b25 If you get Volcanics, you'll need to use Anticipation with Clear Headed 4 in place of Revenge , and replace Snapshot with Revenge . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Freedom right when Anticipation wears off, then finish off Telos. \u2b25 In terms of getting inside the beam, always make an immediate bee-line for the left beam. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you get the right beam, just Surge to it immediately. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you get the back beam, keep going and step into the left beam. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Face Telos by using an ability to stop your movement, then Surge through him to get to the back beam quickly that way. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With this, there's not much of an effective difference between any beam placements.","title":"Telos ranged"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-ranged/#telos-ranged","text":"Telos with Ranged (Courtesy of #Evil Lucario)","title":"Telos ranged"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-ranged/#introduction","text":"Ranged Telos is by far the most difficult, and quickest way to get kills.

This guide will assume you primarily use Magic, but Melee can also tap into many of these fundamentals with some changes. Unfortunately, as Ranged does not have an equivalent to either Destroy or Asphyxiate, it cannot stun-lock Telos to the same degree as either Melee or Magic and therefore will not be included much in this guide. Attack Speeds You vs Telos \u2b25 You attack every 3 ticks / 1.8 seconds (GCD), 4 ticks / 2.4 seconds if you follow up with 4TAA \u2b25 Telos base attack speed is 4 ticks / 2.4 seconds, 3 ticks / 1.8 seconds while in green beam which you generally don't need to worry about Stuns Basic Stuns Impact / Backhand / Binding Shot only stuns when it hits for 1.2 seconds. 100% ability damage with 15 second cooldown. Threshold Stuns \u2b25 Deep Impact / Forceful Backhand / Tight Bindings only stuns when it hits for 3.6 seconds. 200% ability damage with 15 second cooldown. \u2b25 Asphyxiate / Destroy always stuns regardless of accuracy for 3.6 seconds. This is your best stun. Up to four hits of 188% ability damage per hit with 20 second cooldown. Non-stuns that Break Freedom / do not stun but bind, which breaks his Freedom nonetheless. Simple to apply with 4TAA if using Magic, and sticky bombs are also easy enough to throw mid-rotation. Other Stuns \u2b25 Dreadnips can randomly stun for 4.2 seconds, but can be detrimental at higher level play. Avoid using if following a very specific rotation, but can be decent for learners. \u2b25 Jade bakriminel bolts (e) can randomly stun for 4.8 seconds, but can be detrimental at higher level play and are outclassed by ruby/hydrix bakriminel bolts regardless. Avoid completely. Telos's Freedom Enrage Cooldowns \u2b25 150%-249% : 30 second cooldown between Freedom use. \u2b25 250%-999% : 20.4 second cooldown between Freedom use. On P5, when Telos uses Freedom he has stun immunity for 6 seconds, then can be stunned in that 14 second window. \u2b25 1000%-4000% : 10.2 second cooldown between Freedom use. On P5, when Telos uses Freedom he has stun immunity for 6 seconds, then can be stunned in that 4.2 second window. Mechanics \u2b25 Procs whenever off cooldown and if he was bound/stunned between Freedoms. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Example: At 150% enrage, if you bound or stun Telos immediately after Freedom, Telos will always use Freedom exactly 30 seconds after the previous one, even if you didn't bind or stun Telos after that. \u2b25 Right when Telos uses Freedom, his attack cooldown resets and he tries to use his next attack 2 ticks / 1.2 seconds later, even if he just used an attack. \u2b25 If Telos Freedoms right after he uses an attack, Telos would attack in 2 ticks instead of the usual 4 ticks / 2.4 seconds. https://youtu.be/jzrbLGTA1nk Note: This is bad and should be avoided! \u2b25 If Telos Freedoms 1 tick before his next attack, he must wait 2 additional ticks before using his next attack. https://youtu.be/ZigW16NofNw Note: This is good as it acts as a stun! \u2b25 If you proc his Freedom immediately by using a stun ability like Impact or Deep Impact, he will attack on the same tick you can use your next ability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do NOT try to stun immediately after a stun if your first stun triggered Telos's Freedom! The clip below shows how to properly circumvent his Freedom. https://youtu.be/g_Asfm8TCl0 General Stun Combos To maximize stun time, you have to play around both Telos's Freedom and combo your stuns in the best way possible. Stun Combos \u2b25 Longest possible stun uptime below 1000%: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Magic: \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 https://youtu.be/JDoVptf9yIU \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee #1: \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 https://youtu.be/pHRv3QO_BTA \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee #2: \u2192 (dw) \u2192 (5taa) + https://youtu.be/LZuxkRYm71g Note: \"5TAA\", or \"5T\" for short, is doing an autoattack with 2H after using an ability with DW. More info can be found in #dpm-advice-melee , but this 5TAA wastes just enough time between Destroy and Forceful Backhand yet still gains damage to allow for the longest stun duration. You can even replace Forceful Backhand with a bleed Destroy , 5TAA, then use Forceful Backhand ! \u2b25 A slightly more damaging, yet shorter stun by one tick stun combo: \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u2192 https://youtu.be/fxkfSegn7yU \u2b25 If Telos has Freedom up: + any ability, most recommended \u2192 any ability \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At 1000%+, Telos will even Freedom after Deep Impact , allowing you to follow up with Impact for even more stun time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Below 1000%, you can add Impact before Asphyxiate . https://youtu.be/ZigW16NofNw \u2b25 Melee has it differently due to sticky bombs. They're a bit more tricky to use, but they don't rely on stopping your abilities to apply them. To pop Freedom perfectly, you need to throw the sticky bomb right as Telos attacks. Doing this will achieve the same result Ice Barrage can. You may need to delay your actual ability rotation for the best stun time possible, but at least throwing the bomb itself shouldn't be too bad. https://youtu.be/IJP8_d3dG-c \u2b25 A beginner friendly way without 4TAA or sticky bombs: Pop Freedom with / \u2192 use any ability as long as it's not a stun \u2192 (3 hit) / (3 hit) \u2192 / . https://youtu.be/g_Asfm8TCl0 Note: While this combo is not as efficient as using 4TAA or sticky bombs, it's relatively easy to do and doesn't require anything extra beyond abilities. Common Mistakes Actions to Avoid \u2b25 Stunning as soon as Telos attacks makes Telos attack quicker and wastes the stun. Instead, you always want to make sure you stun right before he does any attack. https://youtu.be/jzrbLGTA1nk \u2b25 Following up a Telos Freedom immediately with a stun. If you use a stun right after popping Freedom, you will waste either the entirety of (Impact / Backhand ) or waste most of Asphyxiate ( / Destroy and Deep Impact / Forceful Backhand ). https://youtu.be/B7eumx0U998 \u2b25 Using stuns immediately after another without waiting properly or just mistiming it. This can range from canceling Asphyxiate too early to following up Deep Impact with Impact too quickly to simply mistiming the follow-up stun. Be sure to follow these timings perfectly if you want the maximum stun uptime! Stun Applications Tricks \u2b25 All of the above stun combos can work from P1-P4 to maximize stun time. Sometimes it's more efficient to go maximum DPS as stated in the other channels, but in general these stun rotations do lead to the most damage possible before any special attacks/etc. \u2b25 At the start of P2, P3, and P4 with Magic, there exists a special stun combo you can do. As Telos takes longer to start attacking you and you can pop Telos's Freedom losslessly with + any slow ability like Wild Magic or Corruption Blast , all with dual wield. Then you do (3 hit) \u2192 \u2192 . This normally lasts as long as the \u2192 \u2192 + combo, but as both you and Telos take one tick longer to start attacking, the overall stun uptime is still as long as possible with a perfect Freedom at the end. https://youtu.be/MAYl7tvN1ck \u2b25 When using Detonate inside fonts on P4, you want to release with \u2192 \u2192 (3 hit) \u2192 . This guarantees you will do the 37.5k damage needed to quickly phase him into the next font while preventing Telos from doing anything. https://youtu.be/hMmRE9UuFW0 \u2b25 As a backup, you can force out an to pop Freedom, then one tick later use your normal stun combos. This isn't as efficient as a carefully laid out stun rotation, but if you need to improvise, this can easily save you before any potentially bad situation. https://youtu.be/_jG-TEINbHk Stunning P5 Starting at 250% and above, when Telos Freedoms he gets a 6 second stun immunity on P5. This further punishes bad stunning, but you can still work around this and stun Telos as long as possible. When the phase starts, Telos will always Freedom immediately, which turns out to be a waste for him as you can immediately follow up with stuns after getting inside the green beam and setting up your Sunshine . Telos will Freedom again afterwards, but by this point your stuns will be on cooldown so once they come back, you are free to stun again. At 1000%+, you can no longer stun him as easily. As you only have a 4.2 second window to stun, you only have room for one long stun like Asphyxiate or Deep Impact . Fortunately with enough raw DPS you can circumvent that fine enough, but should you be lacking in DPS in some way, knowing how to stun properly can still make the difference between a death or a kill. In general, you want to stun Telos after he does three autoattacks after his Freedom. This works no matter if you're in the green beam or not. https://youtu.be/MbfruBRsOFU Pay attention to when the Freedom happens and when he gets stunned, which is three attacks after Freedom.","title":"Telos stun guide"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-stun-guide/#telos-stun-guide","text":"How to Properly Stun Telos (Courtesy of #Evil Lucario, #ideal gas for initial guide)","title":"Telos stun guide"},{"location":"pvme-guides/telos/telos-stun-guide/#introduction","text":"Stunning Telos takes some getting used to, but with enough practice and knowledge you can greatly enhance your performance from higher survivability to longer window of time to DPS.

Has extra health and defence stats \u2b25 Due to how combat works in Runescape, you ALMOST ALWAYS want Power Armour, even if it means you have less defence. Any exceptions below will be noted specifically as TANK ARMOUR and will explain why. T80 Armour \u2b25 The standard armour for all PvMing Note: Masterwork, Sirenic, and Superior Zuriels are recommended over their T80 counterparts due to the high cost of Nex armour sets. \u2b25 Priority: Medium T88 Armour \u2b25 Superior Ancient Warrior's equipment \u2b25 Slightly worse defensive bonuses and dps than T90 armour but potentially cheaper. \u2b25 Priority: High for Superior Zuriels, low for others T90 Armour \u2b25 Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour. \u2b25 Priority: High for Masterwork and Sirenic, low for Tectonic T92 Armour \u2b25 The best armour. Relatively small defence and dps boost vs T90 armour. \u2b25 Trimmed masterwork armour's set effect and lower upkeep cost is what sets it apart compared to the other T92 armour sets. Elite sirenic and tectonic do not have set effects at this time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When wearing 3 or more pieces of trimmed masterwork, you will gain 10% damage offset per piece, which will be applied as damage over time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Trimmed masterwork reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective. \u2b25 Elite sirenic is slightly more expensive to upkeep than normal sirenic while elite tectonic is cheaper to use overall than tectonic due to needing specific repair pouches. \u2b25 All three sets do not degrade in Elite Dungeons. \u2b25 Priority: Low Achto \u2b25 T90 tank armour that has a chance to reset all defensive cooldowns when atleast 3 pieces are worn (2% chance per piece worn). \u2b25 Increases damage dealt while wearing a shield/shieldbow at 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level. \u2b25 Generally only used in situations where the cooldown reset is useful, or tanking damage has higher importance than the damage you deal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Most common situation is bringing boots, gloves and helmet for reset chances whilst still using Power Armour top and legs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This way you do not need perk your Tank Armour as well as your Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: Low Cinderbanes \u2b25 BiS gloves for poisonable targets \u2b25 Increases the damage poison hits would deal, as well as being able to refresh and proc damage itself. \u2b25 Priority: High if you can use them, Low otherwise Nightmare Gauntlets \u2b25 Passive Effect: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A 25% increased hitchance when using Snipe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Allows you to move whilst using Snipe. \u2b25 Priority: High Deathtouch Bracelet \u2b25 Passive Effect: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1/5 chance of reflecting 25-50% damage (~7.5% average reflected) back to the attacker. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Unlike the Reflect ability, this does not actually reduce damage received. \u2b25 Priority: High Dominion Tower Gloves \u2b25 Of these gloves, the only ones that have any niche use in PvM are Spellcaster Gloves . When casting a basic ability or an auto attack with these worn, there is a 5% chance of the following effect being applied: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dealing 25% more damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Binding the target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Lowering the target's Magic, Attack, Range, and Defense by 7 levels (does not stack) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Delayed abilities (e.g. blitz spells, sonic) will instantly hit the target \u2b25 Priority: Very Low Blast Diffusion Boots \u2b25 Halves the charge time of the Detonate ability. \u2b25 Generally used as another main threshold for magic. Usually a 3-tick Detonate for 80% charged Detonate (4-tick Detonate is usually only used for its 5x5 AoE) \u2b25 Priority: High Laceration Boots \u2b25 Allows Bladed Dive to be used with only a mainhand or 2h melee weapon \u2b25 Priority: Medium Fleeting Boots \u2b25 Allows movement during Rapid Fire. \u2b25 Increases Rapid fire's hit chance by 10%. \u2b25 Losing line of sight with target prevents movement until rapid fire ends (bug). \u2b25 Priority: Medium TokHaar Capes \u2b25 BiS cape stats Note: Inferior to strength cape and ranged cape until max cape perk slots are unlocked. \u2b25 Priority: Low Weapons General Weapons Introduction \u2b25 In general dual-wield camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps. \u2b25 Using dual-wield also makes shield, Flanking, and Lunging switches easier and more fluid to use. \u2b25 For the best damage output, one should switch between both dual-wield and 2h weapons in order to use abilities that are normally exclusive to either type. T70 Weapons Crystal Halberd \u2b25 T70 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Increased Area of effect for your abilities make it faster than some higher level options. \u2b25 Requires completion of 'Roving Elves'. \u2b25 Is viable until T82, where you can get a Masuta's Warspear as an upgrade. \u2b25 Priority: High if you have completed the quest or are close to completing Verac's Flail, Dahrok's Greataxe, Torag's Hammer, Guthan's Spear \u2b25 T70 2h weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Set effects are not worthwhile as you should be using Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: High if you cannot get a Crystal Halberd Abyssal Whip \u2b25 T70 mainhand weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Very cheap. \u2b25 Can be useful later as a budget Bladed Dive mainhand. \u2b25 Has no off-hand, should use an Enhanced Excalibur or (in a pinch) a Necronium off-hand weapon. \u2b25 Priority: High if you cannot get a Crystal Halberd Ahrim's Wand + Ahrim's Book, Ahrim's Staff \u2b25 T70 2h, mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Set effects are not worthwhile as you should be using Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: High Karil's Pistol Crossbows, Karil's Crossbow \u2b25 T70 mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Set effects are not worthwhile as you should be using Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: High T75-T79 Weapons Godswords \u2b25 T75 2h weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 4 different choices: Armadyl, Bandos, Zamorak and Saradomin. \u2b25 Each Godsword can have its effect set as either a passive or a special, although they're only worth using in passive mode. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Armadyl can raise your combat stats slightly. Not that useful. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bandos can lower the targets defence. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Saradomin can restore you Hitpoints and Prayer points. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Zamorak can freeze (snare) a target in place for 10 seconds. Not that useful outside of edge cases. \u2b25 If you can afford it, Armadyl Godswords can be dissasembled for Armadyl components which are useful for end-game perks. \u2b25 Priority: High if you cannot use the Crystal Halberd and/or need Armadyl components Saradomin Sword \u2b25 T75 2h weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Very cheap. \u2b25 Special Attack: Saradomin's Lightning \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Costs 100% adrenaline \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Strikes the target twice, once with Melee and once with Magic. Both hits do 35%-175% ability damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Special is completely useless due to low damage and high adrenaline cost. \u2b25 Priority: High if you cannot use the Crystal Halberd and want to save money Abyssal Wand + Abyssal Orb \u2b25 T75 mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Chance to save some runes. \u2b25 Priority: High Staff of Light \u2b25 T75 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Chance to save some runes. \u2b25 Special Attack: Power of Light \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Costs 100% adrenaline \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Reduces melee damage taken by 50% for 1 minute. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Switching weapons cancels the effect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Special is useless outside of niche cases, where it would be used with an Essence of Finality. \u2b25 Priority: High Armadyl Crossbows \u2b25 T75 mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable, but a little expensive. \u2b25 If you can afford to, they can be disassembled for Armadyl Components which are useful for end-game perks. \u2b25 Priority: Medium, no T75 bolts Hand Cannon \u2b25 T75 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Requires completion of 'Forgiveness of a Chaos Dwarf' \u2b25 Can explode if unaugmented! Augmentation is mandatory! \u2b25 Worth disassembling for 'Explosive' components which are useful for end-game perks. \u2b25 Special Attack: Aimed Shot \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Costs 50% adrenaline \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Takes longer to fire than a standard attack or ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Has 75% additional accuracy, hits for 30%-200% ability damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Special is completely useless due to low damage and high adrenaline cost. \u2b25 Priority: High Sunspear \u2b25 T78 2h weapon for all combat styles, Untradable quest reward. \u2b25 Requires completion of 'River of Blood', which has a long quest chain. \u2b25 Very cheap. \u2b25 Can be changed freely between Melee, Ranged and Magic, meaning it can train all 3 styles. \u2b25 Can also be a budget Planted Feet switch weapon later (Since you can switch it between Ranged and Magic) \u2b25 Priority: High if you aren't many quests away or enjoy questing. The quest chain is long. Low otherwise T80-T85 Weapons Note: T80 is difficult for Melee as all options have odd requirements and costs. Skipping T80 and waiting until T82 is an option here. Linza's Hammer \u2b25 T80 mainhand weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Requires completion of 'Kindred Spirits'. \u2b25 Will need to pair with a lower tier off-hand. \u2b25 Priority: Medium if you've done the quest or like questing, Low otherwise Virtus Wand + Virtus Book \u2b25 T80 mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessible. \u2b25 Can be a useful source of Zaros components. \u2b25 You should keep these going forward if you have no Ports progress and are unlikely to do so. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Wand: Attuned Crystal Wand and the Wand of the Cywir Elders are your only other available mainhands before T90. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Off-hand: Attuned Crystal Orb of the Cywir Elders are your only other available off-hands before T90. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Off-hand: Without ports you will use this off-hand all the way to T90. \u2b25 Priority: High Zaryte Bow \u2b25 T80 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessible, but more expensive than the Royal Crossbow. \u2b25 Does not use ammo. \u2b25 Priority: High Royal Crossbow \u2b25 T80 2h weapon, Buyable but cannot sell once crafted. \u2b25 Requires 70 Smithing, 60 Summoning and completion of the short quest 'Song from the Depths'. \u2b25 Fairly accessible. \u2b25 Forging the bow requires you to get to the last phase against the Queen Black Dragon. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bring all 4 components (Royal Bolt Stabiliser, Royal Frame, Royal Sight, Royal Torsion Spring) to Thurgo to make the 'unforged' bow. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Fight the Queen Black Dragon in practice mode. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 you need to stand in the 'Extremely Hot' attack and 'brandish' the bow. \u2b25 Priority: High Attuned Crystal Weapons \u2b25 T80 2h, mainhand and off-hand weapons, Untradable. \u2b25 Requires completion of 'Plagues End' \u2b25 Options for all styles. \u2b25 Costs an Attuned Crystal Weapon Seed per weapon (untradable drop) and 1000-2000 Harmonic Dust (untradable resource). \u2b25 Priority: Low due to requirements and cost to make each weapon Chaotic Weapons \u2b25 T80 2h, mainhand and off-hand weapons, Untradable but can be sold back for half tokens. \u2b25 Options for all styles. \u2b25 Costs Dungeoneering tokens. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 200k dungeoneering tokens per mainhand weapon or 2h weapon. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 100k dungeoneering tokens per offhand weapon. \u2b25 Only recommended if you have a surplus of Dungeoneering tokens. \u2b25 Priority: High if you have loads of tokens and really enjoy Dungeoneering, Low otherwise Masuta's Warspear \u2b25 T82 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Increased range. \u2b25 Easily accessible. \u2b25 Viable all the way to T90. \u2b25 Priority: Very High Laniakea's Spear \u2b25 T82 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Increased range. \u2b25 Easily accessible. \u2b25 T75 accuracy, T90 damage. \u2b25 Increases poison application rate to 17.5%, up from 12.5%. \u2b25 Increases poison damage by 5%. \u2b25 Priority: High as budget weapon, especially if you have Cinderbane Gloves Augmented Staff of Limitless Air/Water/Earth/Fire/Lava/Mud/Steam \u2b25 T82 2h weapon, Buyable but cannot sell once crafted. \u2b25 Unlimited runes of that type. \u2b25 Requires 75 Crafting. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Requires a Mystic Staff, a matching talisman and an Elemental Impetus. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Requirement is assistable. \u2b25 Viable all the way to T90. \u2b25 Priority: High Dragonrider Lance \u2b25 T85 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 T90 accuracy, T80 damage. \u2b25 Increased area of effect. \u2b25 Better than the Masuta's Warspear if you keep missing hits. \u2b25 Components are useful for end-game perks, but the spear is expensive. \u2b25 Priority: Very High if you keep missing hits, lowering your training speed Blade of Nymora + Blade of Avaryss \u2b25 T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 T90 accuracy, T80 damage \u2b25 Due to off-hand accuracy being (almost completely) useless, the off-hand (Blade of Avaryss) is effectively a T80 weapon, and less useful unless you need lots of components. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Off-hand ripper claw can be a useful alternative. \u2b25 Components are useful for making a Lunging switch later on. \u2b25 Priority: Very High if you want components for a Lunging switch later on. Low otherwise Ripper Claws \u2b25 T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Increased damage as the targets health gets lower. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The off-hand is sometimes used at the end of long bosses, where the boost is more potent. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is not a common strategy, but it does see use at times. \u2b25 Priority: High if paired with the Blade of Nymora, or you really want the off-hand as a 'meme' low HP switch weapon Tetsu Katana + Tetsu Wakizashi \u2b25 T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Untradable Player Owned Ports reward. \u2b25 Requires significant progress in Player Owned Ports. \u2b25 Can be upgraded to T88 later. \u2b25 Since Melee has 3 different T90 dual wields, this will have no use as a flanking/lunging switch at T90. \u2b25 Priority: Very Low unless you want the fashionscape Wand of the Cywir Elders + Orb of the Cywir Elders \u2b25 T90 accuracy, T80 damage \u2b25 Due to off-hand accuracy being (almost completely) useless, the off-hand (Orb of the Cywir Elders) is effectively a T80 weapon, and less useful unless you need lots of components. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Seasinger Makigai is a great T85 off-hand, if you have the Ports progress. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Virtus Book or an Attuned Crystal Orb are T80 options. \u2b25 Components are useful for making a Planted Feet switch later on. \u2b25 T90 accuracy makes this a good Planted Feet switch later on, since you only switch to it for your ultimate then straight back. \u2b25 Priority: Very High if you are missing a lot, if you want components for a Planted Feet switch later on, and if you want a switch for Planted Feet later Seasinger Kiba + Seasinger Makigai \u2b25 T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Untradable Player Owned Ports reward. \u2b25 Requires significant progress in Player Owned Ports. \u2b25 Can be upgraded to T88 later. \u2b25 Priority: Very High if you want to do ports, since these and their upgraded versions are the best options for switches at T90 for Magic Shadow Glaive + Off-hand Shadow Glaive \u2b25 T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 T90 accuracy, T80 damage \u2b25 Unlike the Wand of the Cywir Elders, you don't have many options here, it's a Glaive or an Off-hand Chaotic Crossbow. \u2b25 Components can be useful for making a Caroming gizmo later on, but is expensive. \u2b25 The mainhand is a very good Planted Feet switch later, due to T90 accuracy. \u2b25 Shadow Glaives have a hidden 'feature' where the off-hands damage is slightly lower if the mainhand is not a Shadow Glaive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to this, an off-hand Shadow Glaive is a sub-optimal off-hand switch for flanking etc. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Off-hand Chaotic Crossbow is the better choice later on, as a result. \u2b25 Priority: Very High if you are missing a lot, if you want components for Caroming later on, and if you want a switch for Planted Feet later Wyvern Crossbow \u2b25 T85 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Applies its own form of poison. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Is improved by Weapon Poison+++ \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Is improved by Cinderbane Gloves \u2b25 Quite expensive. \u2b25 Is very viable at some content (Solak). \u2b25 Priority: Very High if you plan to do nothing but Solak as a Ranger. Low otherwise T87-T89 Weapons Annihilation \u2b25 T87 2h weapon, tradable. \u2b25 Special Attack: Gravitate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Costs 60% adrenaline \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For 30 seconds, you gain 1% increased damage per stack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Does not boost bleed damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stacks are gained whenever you hit a target. (bleed hits count) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stacks are reset after 30 seconds, when you use the special again, when you miss or when you switch main hand weapons. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Not useful due to limitations and 'wind-up' time. \u2b25 Priority: Low. The AoE of a Masuta's Warspear or a Dragonrider Lance will outweigh this Decimation \u2b25 T87 2h weapon, tradable. \u2b25 Does not need ammo. \u2b25 Special Attack: Locate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Costs 50% adrenaline \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For 10 seconds, all your single-target abilities will hit all targets in a 3x3 area centered on your main target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The effect refreshes to 10 seconds if you spec again, and will end if you switch weapons. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Very effective for pushing Shattered Worlds. \u2b25 Priority: High. You don' get many options at this level for Ranging, this is a good one to get you to T90 Obliteration \u2b25 T87 2h weapon, tradable. \u2b25 Special Attack: Devour \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Costs 100% adrenaline \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For 10 seconds, all healing on the target will be 50% effective. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In PvP this effect works on almost everything except heal over time components of food (like Great Gunkan) and Immortality. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In PvM this effect works on a few non-quest monsters such as Nex during blood phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to the adrenaline cost and the damage you could deal otherwise, the special is functionally useless for PvM. \u2b25 Priority: High if you can't get Ports weapons for Magic Elite Tetsu Katana and Elite Tetsu Wakizashi \u2b25 T88 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Untradable Player Owned Ports reward. \u2b25 Requires significant progress in Player Owned Ports. \u2b25 Since Melee has 3 different T90 dual wields, this will have no use as a flanking/lunging switch at T90. \u2b25 Priority: Very Low unless you want the fashionscape Superior Vesta's Longsword \u2b25 T88 2h weapon, Buyable Buyable but cannot sell once crafted. \u2b25 Degrades to dust. \u2b25 No augmentable off-hand version available, will need to be paired with something else. \u2b25 No crafting requirement. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Requires a Vesta's Longsword (Inferior version will not work) and an Ancient Warrior's Equipment Patch. \u2b25 Special Attack: Feint \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Costs 25% adrenaline \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Additionally costs 0.1% maximum charge per special \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hits the target with increased accuracy for 50%-300% ability damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Special has odd damage calculation, meaning it will more often hit in the middle of that range. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to hit caps, viable use cases, and the Amulet of Finality, there are better adrenaline-dump options. \u2b25 Priority: Low. Masuta's Warspear or Dragonrider Lance AoE will still be better for melee training.

Has slightly less defence but extra damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tank Armour. Has extra health and defence stats \u2b25 Due to how combat works in Runescape, you ALMOST ALWAYS want Power Armour, even if it means you have less defence. Any exceptions below will be noted specifically as TANK ARMOUR and will explain why. T80 Armour \u2b25 The standard armour for all PvMing Note: Masterwork, Sirenic, and Superior Zuriels are recommended over their T80 counterparts due to the high cost of Nex armour sets. \u2b25 Priority: Medium T88 Armour \u2b25 Superior Ancient Warrior's equipment \u2b25 Slightly worse defensive bonuses and dps than T90 armour but potentially cheaper. \u2b25 Priority: High for Superior Zuriels, low for others T90 Armour \u2b25 Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour. \u2b25 Priority: High for Masterwork and Sirenic, low for Tectonic T92 Armour \u2b25 The best armour. Relatively small defence and dps boost vs T90 armour. \u2b25 Trimmed masterwork armour's set effect and lower upkeep cost is what sets it apart compared to the other T92 armour sets. Elite sirenic and tectonic do not have set effects at this time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When wearing 3 or more pieces of trimmed masterwork, you will gain 10% damage offset per piece, which will be applied as damage over time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Trimmed masterwork reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective. \u2b25 Elite sirenic is slightly more expensive to upkeep than normal sirenic while elite tectonic is cheaper to use overall than tectonic due to needing specific repair pouches. \u2b25 All three sets do not degrade in Elite Dungeons. \u2b25 Priority: Low Achto \u2b25 T90 tank armour that has a chance to reset all defensive cooldowns when atleast 3 pieces are worn (2% chance per piece worn). \u2b25 Increases damage dealt while wearing a shield/shieldbow at 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level. \u2b25 Generally only used in situations where the cooldown reset is useful, or tanking damage has higher importance than the damage you deal. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Most common situation is bringing boots, gloves and helmet for reset chances whilst still using Power Armour top and legs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This way you do not need perk your Tank Armour as well as your Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: Low Cinderbanes \u2b25 BiS gloves for poisonable targets \u2b25 Increases the damage poison hits would deal, as well as being able to refresh and proc damage itself. \u2b25 Priority: High if you can use them, Low otherwise Nightmare Gauntlets \u2b25 Passive Effect: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A 25% increased hitchance when using Snipe. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Allows you to move whilst using Snipe. \u2b25 Priority: High Deathtouch Bracelet \u2b25 Passive Effect: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1/5 chance of reflecting 25-50% damage (~7.5% average reflected) back to the attacker. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Unlike the Reflect ability, this does not actually reduce damage received. \u2b25 Priority: High Dominion Tower Gloves \u2b25 Of these gloves, the only ones that have any niche use in PvM are Spellcaster Gloves . When casting a basic ability or an auto attack with these worn, there is a 5% chance of the following effect being applied: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dealing 25% more damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Binding the target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Lowering the target's Magic, Attack, Range, and Defense by 7 levels (does not stack) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Delayed abilities (e.g. blitz spells, sonic) will instantly hit the target \u2b25 Priority: Very Low Blast Diffusion Boots \u2b25 Halves the charge time of the Detonate ability. \u2b25 Generally used as another main threshold for magic. Usually a 3-tick Detonate for 80% charged Detonate (4-tick Detonate is usually only used for its 5x5 AoE) \u2b25 Priority: High Laceration Boots \u2b25 Allows Bladed Dive to be used with only a mainhand or 2h melee weapon \u2b25 Priority: Medium Fleeting Boots \u2b25 Allows movement during Rapid Fire. \u2b25 Increases Rapid fire's hit chance by 10%. \u2b25 Losing line of sight with target prevents movement until rapid fire ends (bug). \u2b25 Priority: Medium TokHaar Capes \u2b25 BiS cape stats Note: Inferior to strength cape and ranged cape until max cape perk slots are unlocked. \u2b25 Priority: Low","title":"Armour"},{"location":"pvme-guides/upgrading-info/armour-and-weapons/#weapons","text":"General Weapons Introduction \u2b25 In general dual-wield camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps. \u2b25 Using dual-wield also makes shield, Flanking, and Lunging switches easier and more fluid to use. \u2b25 For the best damage output, one should switch between both dual-wield and 2h weapons in order to use abilities that are normally exclusive to either type.","title":"Weapons"},{"location":"pvme-guides/upgrading-info/armour-and-weapons/#t70-weapons","text":"Crystal Halberd \u2b25 T70 2h weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Increased Area of effect for your abilities make it faster than some higher level options. \u2b25 Requires completion of 'Roving Elves'. \u2b25 Is viable until T82, where you can get a Masuta's Warspear as an upgrade. \u2b25 Priority: High if you have completed the quest or are close to completing Verac's Flail, Dahrok's Greataxe, Torag's Hammer, Guthan's Spear \u2b25 T70 2h weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Set effects are not worthwhile as you should be using Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: High if you cannot get a Crystal Halberd Abyssal Whip \u2b25 T70 mainhand weapon, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Very cheap. \u2b25 Can be useful later as a budget Bladed Dive mainhand. \u2b25 Has no off-hand, should use an Enhanced Excalibur or (in a pinch) a Necronium off-hand weapon. \u2b25 Priority: High if you cannot get a Crystal Halberd Ahrim's Wand + Ahrim's Book, Ahrim's Staff \u2b25 T70 2h, mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Set effects are not worthwhile as you should be using Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: High Karil's Pistol Crossbows, Karil's Crossbow \u2b25 T70 mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 Easily accessable. \u2b25 Set effects are not worthwhile as you should be using Power Armour. \u2b25 Priority: High","title":"T70 Weapons"},{"location":"pvme-guides/upgrading-info/armour-and-weapons/#t75-t79-weapons","text":"Godswords \u2b25 T75 2h weapons, Tradable. \u2b25 4 different choices: Armadyl, Bandos, Zamorak and Saradomin. \u2b25 Each Godsword can have its effect set as either a passive or a special, although they're only worth using in passive mode. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Armadyl can raise your combat stats slightly.

Pvm Incense Stick Guide General Information \u2b25 Incense sticks are created by combining logs, ashes, and herbs. \u2b25 Each incense stick increases the buff duration by 10 minutes. \u2b25 Incense sticks have potency levels ranging from 1-4. This increases by 1 every 10 minutes (30 minutes till max potency), or you can 'overload' by right clicking the incense sticks for an upfront cost of 6 sticks for 10 minutes (each additional stick used after this adds 10 minutes to the duration) \u2b25 Dying will cancel your incense boost as a whole, causing you to have to re-incense, even if you use a ring of death, or are in practice mode. \u2b25 You can have up to 3 different effects active at once at 95 firemaking. Note: In practice, overloading instantly is almost always better. Relevant Incense Sticks \u2b25 Spirit Weed \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each potency level provides a 10% increased familiar special attack recovery rate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Worth using everywhere you use familiar special attacks often \u2b25 Kwuarm \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each potency level provides a +2.5% weapon poison damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Worth using against poisonable targets \u2b25 Irit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each potency level reduces poison damage by 25% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Worth using mostly at Gregorovic since he drains antipoison very quickly, otherwise it is a good option anywhere you get poisoned if you don't have access to other antipoison methods. \u2b25 Lantadyme \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each potency level increases potion timer by 30 seconds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Not usually cost effective to use but can reduce the need to make more overloads. Use at your discretion. \u2b25 Fellstalk (For Slayer) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each potency level provides a x1.01 chance to spawn elite monsters \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Worth using if hunting specific drops from elite slayer monsters such as Edimmu pet \u2b25 Ranarr \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each potency level gives a +1 prayer bonus \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Functionally useless Note: Incense sticks are rather expensive to use in dangerous pvm due to having to re-incense upon death, so it is advised to only use them in higher level pvm where their benefits are quite tangible for their value or where their cost will be offset by profit.

If you are using crossbows it is highly recommended that you use bakriminel bolts (e) for increased DPM. Here's a rundown of the current meta.

Shattered Worlds \u2b25 Bladed Dive (Requires level 65 Attack) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A great mobility ability, has a 10 tile range from your current position at any angle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally used in conjunction with surge/escape, sometimes on the same tick, for greater mobility. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Functions as a 3x3 AoE ability when used off global cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cooldown instantly resets if the target dies within 10 ticks (6 seconds) of using Bladed Dive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Priority: High Note: goes from 3x3 to 5x5 when used in conjuction with noxious scythe and laceration boots. \u2b25 Greater Dazing Shot (Requires level 8 Ranged) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Gives Dazing Shot a puncture stack each time it is used, with a maximum of 10 puncture stacks on a target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Puncture stacks last 9 seconds and hit 4 times (every 3 ticks or 1.8 seconds), dealing 8%-10% ability damage per stack over its duration. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Puncture bleed does not count for: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Aftershock building \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Soulsplit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Araxxor web shield reflect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Personal damage multipliers such as scrimshaws \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Combat experience \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Challenge gems \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Nex's blood phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Priority: Medium Note: Salt the Wound and Greater Dazing Shot both reset the stack duration (9 seconds) even if they splash, only Greater Dazing Shot will increase puncture count though. \u2b25 Salt the Wound (Requires level 60 Ranged) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A threshold that deals 37.6%-188% ability damage at 0 puncture stacks, going up to 73.6-368% with 10 puncture stacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally never used since it required 8+ stacks to be viable. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Priority: Low Note: Unlocking Greater Dazing Shot also unlocks Salt the Wound .","title":"Abilities Unlocked by Activities"},{"location":"pvme-guides/upgrading-info/upgrade-decisions/","text":"Upgrade decisions How to Use Upgrade Order The lists in #upgrade-order are recommended natural combat style progression templates for players to follow. Upgrades are ranked based on many factors to determine the best progression for general bossing -- that is to say, the listed upgrade order may not be the best order for the bosses you do. Equally problematic, creating individual upgrade orders for every single boss would not work as most players do not do only 1 boss but rather several. Therefore, the best way to present upgrade order is to present a list and teach how to determine which upgrades are best for you. Below is the current Melee upgrade order at the time of writing (2021/06/24). Araxxor Melee was used to demonstrate the thought process for adapting upgrade order to specific content. In this example, you will notice some upgrades recommended by the general list are skipped/omitted (crossed out) here while others have been moved (+) to better reflect the specific needs presented by the Araxxor boss fight. See #araxxor-melee for more information about the strategies mentioned and #mastery-system-reqs for speed references. Although this upgrade order is specific to Araxxor Melee, the critical thinking concepts are not and can be translated to other bosses. If you find yourself having any difficulties deciding what upgrade would best fit the content you do, please ask for assistance in #unknown-channel or #unknown-channel . Araxxor Specific Needs \u2b25 Accuracy - Araxxor has reasonably high defense \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prioritize weapons with high accuracy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use the strongest possible accuracy aura (Berserker Aura > T4 Brawler ). \u2b25 Burst - the Araxxor fight is split into 4 100k hp phases \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee's go-to ultimate ability is Berserk . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Perfect for bursting a phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- As you speed up, you will run into cooldown problems. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Upgrades which improve your burst capabilities are prioritized. Annotated Upgrade Order for Melee Araxxor Note: All upgrades will be listed in bold. Araxxor will commonly be abbreviated to 'rax'. Stage 1: No Real Variance Based on Content \u2b25 Berserker Aura \u2b25 Blade of Nymora + off-hand Ripper claw/Masuta's Warspear / Melee benefits heavily from dual wield/2h switching as it gives access to both Decimate and Cleave as well as Destroy and later gFlurry . A Blade of Nymora offers you a cheap mainhand with T90 accuracy which is important for rax while an offhand Ripper Claw is a cheap offhand with T85 damage. Masuta's Warspear is a 2h with T82 accuracy and damage to be used for and occasionally Hurricane . \u2b25 Level 95 Prayer \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Should also complete The Temple at Senntisten quest. \u2b25 Level 99 Herblore \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Can boost from 99 to make Elder Overloads with the aid of pulse cores, and can request assistance to make Adrenaline Renewals Normal Overloads are good but the extra stats from Elder Overloads are definitely worth the price when bossing. Any combination with your Elder Overloads such as making them into Elder Overload Salves is optional. \u2b25 Drygores MH + Ripper Claw OH + \u2b25 Entry Level Perks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Refer to #perks Starter Perks for Entry Level Perks. Here you should sell your Blade of Nymora to purchase and a Drygore mainhand to acquire an additional 10 tiers of damage. Your offhand only accounts for 33% of your damage compared to your mainhand's 66% so upgrading your offhand is not recommended yet. Entry level perks also offer a serious damage increase and should be aquired here. \u2b25 Superior Vesta's Spear with Entry Level Perks Superior Vesta's Spear is a T88 2h created by combining a Vesta's Spear with an Ancient Warrior Equipment patch and should be augmented immediately. It uses the same degrade system as T90 armours ; however, your first one will likely last you until you reach your next 2h upgrade. You can sell your Masuta's Warspear here or keep it to be used as a halberd for slayer. At this point, it would be ok to start trying rax; however, you should expect slow kills. \u2b25 Strength Skillcape \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Primarily beneficial for extended Dismember duration. All upgrades above this line should be the same for every boss. \u2b25 T90 Armour Definitely go for good dps perks on this rather than perks like Scavenging. If you want Scavenging for slayer, put it on a piece of augmented Bandos armour . \u2b25 Laceration Boots \u2b25 Cinderbane Gloves Rax is poison immune. If your goal is to mainly do rax, you should skip Cinderbane Gloves . \u2b25 Amulet of Souls \u2b25 Greater Barge \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Feel free to use the !barge command in #unknown-channel for more information. gBarge is a massive upgrade for rax as it significantly improves your burst capabilities. \u2b25 Greater Flurry gFlurry improves your overall dps and fills out a basic rotation. At this point you are ready to start using rotations from #araxxor-melee . You will still need to improvise some rotations, P4 in particular; however, you should notice a serious uptick in your kill speeds. Beware, you should not use the recommended DBA spec as your accuracy is not high enough yet. \u2b25 Biting 4 Biting 4 is a decent general upgrade; however, in the context of rax it is not noticeably better than Biting 3. With the real cost of roughly 3 times as expensive as listed (due to acquiring components in batches of 20), it is ok to push this back until after Zaros Godsword . \u2b25 Limitless Natural Instinct can commonly be used for your P3 at rax, saving Apot for P4. Limitless is therefore less impactful than it would be at many other bosses and should be purchased later in the list. Stage 2: Some Variance Based on Content/Wealth \u2b25 An off-hand t80 Flanking 4 Switch You cannot flank rax so you should skip this. \u2b25 Zaros Godsword For rax, this is the most important upgrade as it is the solution to your cooldown problem. From this point on, you can follow almost all strategies in #araxxor-melee . Slightly different P2 Top Path (no Masterwork Spear ) and P4 rotation (no Seren Godbow - substitute for ) are needed. You should be using a Ripper Demon familiar by now. Your gear should be enough to achieve the @Araxxor Adept times. +\u2b25 Storm Shards and Shatter Storm Shards and Shatter are unlocked via a Mazcab Ability Codex. For the advanced Mid path strategy, shards are stacked throughout P1 and P2 to be shattered during your P3 . This rotation saves up to 10s every kill -- a substantial improvement for such a cheap upgrade. Shards are, however, rarely used in advanced strategies -- especially for solo bosses -- and should not be considered a general upgrade. \u2b25 Masterwork Spear of Annihilation + Lunging Masterwork Spear gives you access to the meta Top P2 rotations. It also allows for a better P4 rotation ( replaces ). +\u2b25 Limitless Now would be a good time to acquire Limitless for rax. You will use it to clean up your P4 rotation and consistently before 25k hp. \u2b25 Essence of Finality (adding Dragon Claws is recommended) When doing ideal rotations at rax, you do not have the additional adrenaline for EoF special attacks. Instead you are purchasing EoF for the stats and for the Reaper Necklace passive. Adding an Ornament Kit is optional and likely not worth until later due to the costs. This passive finally provides you the accuracy needed to start using the top path strat with a Quake . \u2b25 Drygore OH At this point you should be closing in on @Araxxor Master times; however, they are likely still out of reach. \u2b25 P6AS1 + AS4E2 (or P6R1 on 2h) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 AS4 is a very strong perk in its own right. If you fail going for AS4E2, feel free to use AS4 in its place for the time being. AS4 is more than enough for rax. Dont worry if you don't get AS4E2 . \u2b25 Malevolence \u2b25 Custom Fitted Trimmed Masterwork By no means a necessity but TMW will make P4 at high enrage less risky. \u2b25 Noxious Scythe Noxious Scythe is a popular weapon for rax; however, the best rax strategies require dual wield/2h switching -- negating Scythe's only strength, its range. It can still be used as a quality of life improvement during some of the more timegated phases, but for that purpose it should be purchased later on. Stage 3: Pretty Low ROI +\u2b25 Seren Godbow and Ingenuity of the Humans SGB unlocks the best P4 rotation. IoH is needed to ensure your spec does not splash. You now have all the gear needed to follow all rotations in #araxxor-melee . +\u2b25 Terrasaur Maul and Erethdor's Grimoire Terrasaur Maul has very low ROI when compared to most of the upgrades recommended above, and Erethdor's Grimoire is expensive to maintain. However, these two upgrades are most likely to shore up your rotations and ensure you have the damage you need to get over the final hurtles. At this point, your gear is capable of consistently achieving @Araxxor Master times. \u2b25 An off-hand t90 Flanking 4 Switch \u2b25 Khopesh Khopesh provide a small dps increase. At rax they mostly negate the need for if using . \u2b25 Greater Fury gFury is a quality of life upgrade. +\u2b25 Noxious Scythe If you want to reduce a bit of damage during timegated phases, get Scythe here. \u2b25 Upgrade to Flanking 4 Equilibrium 1 These last upgrades do not offer much in terms of improving kill times and are more for improving quality of life. Final Upgrade Order Summary for Melee Araxxor \u2b25 Berserker Aura \u2b25 Blade of Nymora + off-hand Ripper claw/Masuta's Warspear \u2b25 Level 95 Prayer \u2b25 Level 99 Herblore \u2b25 Drygores MH + Ripper Claw OH \u2b25 Entry Level Perks \u2b25 Superior Vesta's Spear with Entry Level Perks At this point, it would be ok to start trying rax; however, you should expect slow kills. \u2b25 Strength Skillcape All upgrades above this line should be the same for every boss. \u2b25 T90 Armour \u2b25 Laceration Boots \u2b25 Amulet of Souls \u2b25 Greater Barge \u2b25 Greater Flurry At this point you are ready to start using rotations from #araxxor-melee. You will still need to improvise some rotations, P4 in particular; however, you should notice a serious uptick in your kill speeds. Beware, you should not use the recommended DBA spec as your accuracy is not high enough yet. \u2b25 Biting 4 \u2b25 Zaros Godsword (Most important upgrade) From this point on, you can follow almost all strategies in #araxxor-melee. Slightly different P2 Top Path and P4 rotations are needed. You should be using a Ripper Demon familiar by now. Your gear should be enough to achieve the Araxxor Adept times. +\u2b25 Storm Shards + Shatter \u2b25 Masterwork Spear of Annihilation + Lunging +\u2b25 Limitless \u2b25 Essence of Finality \u2b25 Drygore OH At this point you should be closing in on Araxxor Master times; however, they are likely still out of reach. \u2b25 P6AS1 + AS4E2 (or P6R1 on 2h) \u2b25 Malevolence \u2b25 Custom Fitted Trimmed Masterwork +\u2b25 Seren Godbow + Ingenuity of the Humans +\u2b25 Terrasaur Maul + Erethdor's Grimoire At this point, your gear is capable of consistently achieving Araxxor Master times. \u2b25 Khopesh \u2b25 Greater Fury +\u2b25 Noxious Scythe These last upgrades do not offer much in terms of improving kill times and are more for improving quality of life.

Rago Hub spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Overview Bomb Tank Strategy Summary Base Tank Strategy Summary Phase 1 In phase 1, Blue Bombs have a drastic chance of dragging the Bomb Tank from his climb. To prevent this from happening, the Base Tank has to keep Vorago far enough on the eastern wall, so that no blues are launched at the climber. Only once they reached the final platform from which they can voke , the Base Tank lures Vorago closer to the west. Base Tank Stall Vorago and delay the first Red Bomb until shortly before the Bomb Tank can voke . The goal with stalling the Red Bomb launch that long is to avoid one being launched early during jump. If done correctly, the second Red Bomb will be fired after the Bomb Tank has jumped. Phase 1 Diagram: \u2b25 Disrupt and Excalibur as you drop into Phase 1. \u2b25 Starting point is the white rectangle, MD east of Vorago. \u2b25 Apply SWH in TC. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use thresholds until your bomb tank jumps. \u2b25 Bladed dive to the south east corner. \u2b25 At your 3rd - 4th ability after TC, as Vorago does his first auto attack, start walking to the north east corner, along the eastern wall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If done correctly, Vorago is not going to auto you at all while walking north, so you have long soul split uptime. \u2b25 At the north eastern corner, pray flick until the Red Bomb is launched (utilise Devotion if necessary). \u2b25 Bladed dive to the west before the non-homing Blue Bomb hits you, so that the Bomb Tank can voke Vorago. \u2b25 South-voke Vorago ASAP. \u2b25 As the Bomb Tank jumps, escape and bladed dive to the southern wall, then walk back to the north and keep building to 100% with defensives. \u2b25 Ideally Vorago switches aggro to the Bomb Tank, if not, keep pray flicking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago does a slight turn-around of ~ 45\u00b0 clock-wise if he switches aggro. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can see Blue Bombs being fired by watching Vorago's animation during the jump. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Vorago switches to the Bomb Tank during jump, voke after, to allow your Bomb Tank to step under. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Vorago stays on the Base Tank, step under and Heal Other / Devotion Intercept . \u2b25 After jump, use Metamorphosis . Phase 1 Base Tank Example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTs6laViJfE Bomb Tank \u2b25 Do a normal climb. \u2b25 Once you have reached the final platform, voke Vorago. \u2b25 Use SGB , thresholds and a couple of basics. \u2b25 Jump 1 - 2 ticks before the first Blue Bomb hits. \u2b25 Ideally Vorago switches aggro to you. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Vorago switches to you during your jump, Devotion Intercept the Base Tank afterwards (alternatively: step under and Heal Other ). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Vorago stays on the Base Tank during your jump, voke afterwards and step away, to allow the Base Tank for stepping under. Phase 2 Both players should utilise Guthix Staff and Storm Shards throughout the phase. Your goal should be to always apply 10 shards by Bring Him Down. Base Tank \u2b25 Bladed dive back under Vorago after escaping the second bleed , to avoid the launched Blue Bomb. \u2b25 Red bombs 1 and 3 cade cept . \u2b25 Devotion before second and last reflect to prevent eating during Bring Him Down. Bomb Tank \u2b25 Cade cept the second Red Bomb. \u2b25 Tag all gravity fields. Bring Him Down \u2b25 Ranged \u2192 \u2192 \u2b25 Mage \u2192 \u2192 Note: If both players use magic, Shatter should be utilised for consistently passing the damage check. Phase 3 Ceilings It is highly recommended to drop a combat dummy in the end of Phase 2 and use Natural Instinct for Ceilings Phase 3. Phase Strategy \u2b25 Base Tank voke entire phase. \u2b25 Both Base and Bomb Tank ultimate / and Apot . \u2b25 Base Tank apply SWH on TC. \u2b25 At Reflect , the Bomb Tank devo cepts . \u2b25 After Vorago jumped for the second time, the Base Tank should move closer. \u2b25 At the Red Bomb, the Base Tank devo cepts . Phase 4 Scopulus The goal is to camp magic protection prayer for the Blue Bombs and run away from all Scopuli in order to avoid melee slaps. Pathing Scopulus \u2b25 Whoever has 2 Scopuli on them, voke the third. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During Barricade and Devotion Intercept , both players DD (to avoid Scopuli decoupling). \u2b25 Walk around the arena clock-wise in a circle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not walk out the corners. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not walk too close to the center, or Scopuli will not be in line of sight any longer if they get stuck behind Vorago. Strategy Intercept does not register while moving. Make sure you stand still when cepting! Phase 4 Diagram: \u2b25 Base Tank start at the green circle in the north-west and tag the northern Scopulus. \u2b25 Bomb Tank start at the red circle in the south-west and tag both of the southern Scopuli. \u2b25 Meet your partner at the white cross in the middle of the western wall. \u2b25 At the second Blue Bomb, the Bomb Tank cade cepts . \u2b25 Bomb Tank vokes the northern Scopulus in order to stack all 3. \u2b25 After Barricade runs out, the Bomb Tank devo cepts . \u2b25 As Intercept runs out, the Base Tank follows devo cept . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the phase is expected to take longer than 5-10 seconds after the Base's devo cept runs out, the Base Tank should Barricade Intercept . Note: Most of the times, as you kill the last Scopulus, you are going to drop target and will not be able to build adrenaline with defensive abilities any longer. Due to this, it is highly recommended to place a combat dummy as the last Scopulus dies. Phase 4 Scopulus Example (Base Tank POV) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neAeSDWC4OU Phase 5 Vitalis The goal is to camp melee protection prayer and pray flick every single Blue Bomb you receive on-tick. Make sure to always eat up to 6,000 or higher life points, due to a Blue Bomb easily knocking you out otherwise. Strategy \u2b25 Base Tank pre-ultimate / and Apot . \u2b25 Bomb Tank apply SWH on TC. \u2b25 At Reflect , the Bomb Tank devo cepts . \u2b25 Handling Bleeds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Base Tank must voke before Vorago applies the first Bleed . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bomb Tank cade cepts bleeds 1 - 4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Base Tank Freedom the fourth Bleed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bomb Tank voke and Freedom the last Bleed. \u2b25 If the phase takes a lot longer after Bleeds are over, the Base Tank can utilise Devotion Intercept . Note: If the Bomb Tank has Malletops Perk unlocked, they can alternatively skip their voke for the last Bleed . Refresh Intercept as Barricade's timer reaches 11 seconds. The Base Tank has to Freedom the last Bleed instead of the fourth. Tips & Tricks \u2b25 Excalibur should be activated in the start of Phase 5. \u2b25 Base and Bomb tank position next to each other to ensure no spawned Vitali blocking their line of sight to each other. \u2b25 Ideally, position west of Vorago at the L-Rock, where one player can utilize Flanking (blue circled tile). Phase 5 Vitalis Example (Base Tank POV) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZCW_qE8kP0 Phase 6 Green Bomb If comfortable, Natural Instinct can be used in the end of Phase 5 on the Vitali surrounding you (make sure you are not killing your last targeted Vitalis, or you will drop target and can not use defensive abilities for adrenaline gain once dropping into Phase 6). This is going to increase the consistency of skipping the second Green Bomb, thus saving you a lot of food. Strategy \u2b25 Bomb Tank voke the entire phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Base should step under throughout this phase. \u2b25 Both Base and Bomb Tank pre-ultimate / and utilise their Apot . \u2b25 Base Tank apply SWH on TC. \u2b25 Bomb Tank activates Disruption Shield for the first Blue Bomb. \u2b25 Handling Green Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the first Green Bomb targets the Bomb Tank, sip a dose of your Powerburst of Vitality . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the first Green Bomb targets the Base Tank, either sip a dose of your Powerburst of Vitality or, if successfully stepped under for all auto attacks, simply tank the 10,000 and eat once or twice after the detonation. \u2b25 Resonance the second Blue Bomb in Reflect . \u2b25 Whoever does not receive the second Green Bomb should Devotion Intercept the other player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make sure to have high enough life points for the Red Bomb following the second Green Bomb. Phase 6 Green Bomb Example (Base Tank POV) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mii85UTiTdQ Phase 7 Team Split Use Reprisal situationally, depending on your life points, adrenaline and Vorago's remaining life points. Strategy \u2b25 Bomb Tank vokes the entire phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Base Tank should step under throughout this phase. \u2b25 Bomb Tank apply SWH on TC. \u2b25 At the start of Reflect , both players ultimate / . \u2b25 Resonance the first Blue Bomb in Reflect . \u2b25 Base Tank devo cepts the Red Bomb after the second Team Split. Phase 8 The End Strategy \u2b25 Base Tank apply SWH on TC. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is ideal to use your SGB in the first quadrant, as it is guaranteed to connect all 5 arrows. \u2b25 At the quadrant with Blue Bombs, the Bomb Tank devo cepts and the Base Tank tags all bombs. \u2b25 At the quadrant with Red Bombs, each player tags 2 bombs. \u2b25 Between the third and last quadrant, both players ultimate / with Apot . \u2b25 At stand-up, the Base Tank vokes . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bomb Tank should step under after stand-up. Note: If a second stand-up is possibly happening, switch around Devotion Intercept and tagging Blue Bombs. Again, both players tag 2 Red Bombs each. Alternative Strategy \u2b25 Ignore the quadrant with Blue Bombs. \u2b25 Tag 2 Red Bombs each. \u2b25 At stand-up, one player uses Barricade Intercept . Phase 9 - Team Split Both players should utilise Guthix Staff and Storm Shards throughout the phase. Your goal should be to always apply 10 shards by the third Waterfall. Base Tank \u2b25 After each Waterfall, surge under Vorago and step under. \u2b25 If not skipping the Stone Clone, use Anticipation or Freedom before the clone's spawn. \u2b25 After each Team Split, Barricade Intercept . \u2b25 Voke for bleeds 3, 4 and 5 ( \u2192 + \u2192 ). \u2b25 Use Devotion for yourself during Reflect (do no Intercept ). Bomb Tank \u2b25 After each Waterfall, keep Vorago voked until Bleeds. \u2b25 Devotion for yourself (do not Intercept ) the fourth Blue Bomb (first Blue Bomb after the Stone Clone's spawn). \u2b25 Take bleeds 1 and 2 ( \u2192 ). Phase End Just like in the end of Phase 2, it is highly recommended to place a combat dummy in the end of Phase 9. Use Natural Instinct to have more adrenaline available in the start of Phase 10. Phase 10 - Team Split Strategy \u2b25 Every odd number of Team Splits (after first, third, fifth, etc), your team rotates applying SWH and Barricade Intercept . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The person not barricading is the one hammering . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 SWH should be applied at start of Reflect , to not lose DPS uptime. \u2b25 Important Line up vertically, so that both players have the same distance to Vorago - You will force both Blue Bombs to hit in the same tick, avoiding one square push back each auto attack Vorago fires. \u2b25 Disruption Shield should only be used after the first Team Split of the phase, or after messing up Lining Up. \u2b25 Generally speaking, throughout a longer Phase 10, utilising a stable order of thresholds is going to generate more stall than using ultimates. \u2b25 Check #vorago-tips-and-tricks for more information about how stall works. Note: To avoid high food consumption, Reprisal should be used for Team Splits that one person follows with cade cepts Starting Phase 10 \u2b25 As you drop into Phase 10, the Base Tank should pre-ultimate / and apply SWH on TC. \u2b25 Both players Disruption Shield the first Blue Bomb after the first Team Split. \u2b25 The Bomb Tank starts with cade cepting for the second Blue Bomb (tank the first with disrupt ). \u2b25 During Reflect , both players move melee distance for the third auto attack. \u2b25 After the second Team Split, both players use thresholds. \u2b25 The Base Tank should keep in mind they will have to Barricade Intercept after the third Team Split. \u2b25 If the Bomb Tank has excess adrenaline, they can eventually ultimate / . \u2b25 After the third Team Split, the Base Tank cade cepts the first Blue Bomb. Mauling \u2b25 You should always wait with mauling until the start of a Reflect in order to optimise your Phase 11 start. \u2b25 Using Shield Dome right before mauling is going to cancel the maul animation, providing you more time during the phase transition. \u2b25 Shield Dome cannot be used off GCD (you have to wait for your GCD to be over, then Shield Dome \u2192 Maul). \u2b25 The player not mauling should reapply the SWH and place a combat dummy in the very east. \u2b25 During the phase transition, both players build up to 100% on the dummy (use defensive abilities + auto attacks). Phase 10 Example (Base Tank POV) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaawIOmKJcw Phase 11 - Team Split Strategy \u2b25 After every Team Split, your team rotates ultimating / and Barricade Intercept . \u2b25 At the start of each Reflect , the player not barricading should reapply the SWH . \u2b25 Disruption Shield should optimally be used when scuffing lining up or after a Purple Bomb detonation. \u2b25 Important Line up vertically, like you did in Phase 10. Starting Phase 11 \u2b25 Both players ultimate / start of the phase. \u2b25 The person who did not Barricade last in Phase 10 should cade cept the first Blue Bomb after the first Team Split. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The other player reapplies the SWH . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The person who barricades builds to 100% quickly in order to ultimate. \u2b25 Rotationally switch Barricade Intercept and ultimates / for every Team Split.

Introduction Hard Mode Vorago (HM) is a variant of Vorago where the fight is extended from 5 to 11 phases, of which only phases 9 to 11 depend on the weekly rotation. Knowledge of all the Normal Mode (NM) rotations as well as Reflect timings are essential when learning this mode. Strategies do not vary from 4 - 7 man, thence the recommended team size is 5 . \u2b25 This guide will be separated into roles, combat styles and skill levels - It will not cover DPS rotations by any means \u2b25 This guide focuses on transferring and adapting gained knowledge from NM to HM, rather than explaining mechanics and role responsibilities from scratch \u2b25 Most warnings and specific comments can be found in the DPS section and will not be repeated for other roles \u2b25 After each phase finishes, you are supposed to build to 100% adrenaline for the next phase (usually the team coordinates dummies for each phase) The first section of this guide explains every phase and how to deal with it using general strategies. Every phase will have the respective attack order and relevant mechanics. This section will also treat TL5 as a DPS: the DPS strategies and responsibilities will be explained only. This section covers phases 1 - 8. The second section is dedicated to tank roles. The Base Tank section is applicable to all styles, but the recommended combat style is melee . The Bomb Tank section is applicable to ranged and mage , with the only differences being the use of ultimates . This section covers phases 1 - 8. The last section explains phases 9 - 11 depending on the weekly special mechanic and is split into all 6 rotations with roles and their respective responsibilities. For DPS rotations refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg Requirements Note: Mauling all NM rotations is not a requirement. That is only needed to create an instance or start the challenge, but you can still join someone else. \u2b25 Proper gear (T90+ weapons, T80+ power armour, Invention perks) \u2b25 Knowledge of all weekly special mechanics / rotations in Normal Mode \u2b25 Intercept is required for all roles and there should always be at least one person capable of replacing a Bomb Tank in case they die \u2b25 Anyone meleeing is responsible for applying the Statius's Warhammer special attack in DPS phases (split by phases if there are multiple meleers on the team) \u2b25 Vorago should be debuffed for the majority of all phases, including SWH , Guthix Staff and potentially Blackstone Arrows for phases 10 / 11 \u2b25 A Powerburst of Vitality (Entry hit, Green Bomb and Team Split team split) as well as having 14,000 life points to avoid failing the entry hit \u2b25 Nihils are mandatory for all team sizes and roles. Note: Do not use Ice Nihils Recommendations \u2b25 Heal Other \u2b25 Zaros Godsword for meleers \u2b25 Eldritch Crossbow for rangers \u2b25 Seren Godbow \u2b25 Basic knowledge of Target Cycle Presets These are just examples, you do not need all the switches and types of food.

It is capped at 14,000 damage per player, instead of 12,500 . Tips Things that help getting the HP needed: Fortitude prayer and a solid food . You may also use your Vitality potion 15 seconds after challenging. The best way to time this is using Preparation as soon as the challenge prompt appears. Sip your Powerburst of Vitality when the cooldown is at 5 seconds left on Preparation. Using Vitality and having the HP needed is recommended, because if you fail the entry hit due to timing your poorly, the team will most likely wait until its CD wears off, resulting in a waste of aura time. Other helpful things to get entry hp: \u2b25 Font of Life (Archaeology Relic) is helpful to get extra HP \u2b25 Using the Thermal effect from Oo'glog is also helpful Phases and Mechanic Breakdown Phase Breakdown There are 11 phases in Hard Mode. \u2b25 Phases 1 - 8 stay always the same. \u2b25 Phase 9 HM is the same as Phase 4 NM (Waterfall-phase) with some additional changes as described following. \u2b25 Phase 10 and 11 are maul phases with the same pushback mechanic as Phase 5 NM. The order is always: Phase 1: Top Lure (Piece) Phase 2: Bring Him Down (Piece) Phase 3: Ceiling Collapse Phase 4: Scopulus Phase 5: Vitalis Phase 6: Green Bomb Phase 7: Team Split Phase 8: The End Phase 9: Waterfall (Piece) Phase 10: Maul Phase 11: Maul https://i.imgur.com/pB3bo1z.png Rewards \u2b25 Mauling in Phase 11 will grant you the in-game title the Defeater as well as an outfit piece depending on the weekly rotation. \u2b25 Having obtained all outfit pieces (6/6 rotations) is a requirement to be eligible to receive the Ancient Artefact (Bombi pet) drop. https://i.imgur.com/F61kKIC.png Differences from Normal Mode \u2b25 Warnings : This is the most important change in Hard Mode . Warning messages do not appear in Hard Mode, which means that Reflect will not be announced, and thus it is easy to PK on accident if you do not know when the respective mechanic happens. Make sure you memorize all the Reflect timings for all the weekly special mechanics to avoid these issues. The only \"warning\" that appears is on The End (Phase 8) with the Purple Bomb timer (this is also true for The End p9/10/11). \u2b25 Entry Hit : Total damage is increased from 50,000 to 70,000 and the per player damage cap from 12,500 to 14,000 \u2b25 Reflects : Players who attack during a Reflect will deal damage to both themselves and the linked players \u2b25 Blue Bombs : Up to 2 bombs are fired at the same time instead of only one (independent of team size) \u2b25 Red Bombs : Damage increased by 50% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Minimum damage is increased from 2,000 to 3,000 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Maximum damage dealt by standing close to other players is increased from 7,000 to 10,500 \u2b25 Phase 1 Climb : Vorago has a chance of dragging the climber back into the arena every time the player is hit by a Blue Bomb \u2b25 Smashes : Bleed damage is increased from 1,200 to 3,000 and stacked bleeds increase from 6,000 to 10,000 Additionally, there are also phase-specific changes: DPS/TL5 - Introduction The DPS and TL5 are essentially the same role with a few exceptions. On Phase 1, the TL5 must do the usual climb just like in Normal Mode and Provoke . The DPS acts like a Normal Mode DPS: standing close to Vorago and helping lower the HP. Notes \u2b25 On phases 2 and 9 the TL5 takes bleeds , which leaves all other phases unchanged for all DPS and the TL5 \u2b25 For this section of the guide, the TL5 is only mentioned when specific responsibilities are required on top of being a DPS. \u2b25 The DPS should stand at a maximum of 2 - 3 tiles away from Vorago throughout phases 1 - 9, and up to 2 tiles for phases 10 - 11. Positioning for DPS and TL5 throughout Phases 3 - 8 Strategy Summary DPS/TL5 - Phases 1 & 2 DPS/TL5 - Phase 1 In the start, every player will receive a Red Bomb that deals 2,000 damage, except the person who stood on the TL spot at face. However, if someone is nearby, that hit can increase, scaling like in Normal Mode. After the first wave of reds, all following bombs will scale with the HM base damage of 3,000 . \u2b25 Spread out and stay in distance to other players in order to avoid increased damage \u2b25 Surge is not recommended, as you might get too close to another player, resulting in PKs with the Reds \u2b25 By the time the Red Bomb explodes, the Tl5 should be at the entry obstacle in the west \u2b25 Due to all Blue Bomb's potential of dragging the climber, the TL5 must jump as soon as possible There is always a chance of a random Red Bomb happening. If you get one, pray Magic and move away from all players until it explodes. Do not go farther out than the Bomb Tanks. The following gif shows what's been explained above: the TL5 must get to the spot, Provoke and Jump as soon as possible, regardless of Vorago's HP. DPS/TL5 - Phase 2 \u2b25 The TL5 takes the 5th Bleed , approaching the phase similar to NM \u2b25 Bring Him Down: The time available to retrieve the Maul Piece (b) is reduced to 7.8 seconds \u2b25 Use 1 - 2 thresholds, then continue building with basics \u2b25 Build on the placed Combat Dummy once Vorago dies Disruption Shield can be utilized at the start of BHD. It will be off CD early in Phase 3, easily allowing for more damage mitigation. DPS/TL5 - Phases 3 - 8 DPS/TL5 - Phase 3 Ceilings \u2b25 You must have shadows enabled to at least medium to be able to see rocks falling \u2b25 All DPS should spread out centrally in the southern half of the arena \u2b25 After Vorago jumps, pay attention on the rock's location and pray Deflect Magic in case you get hit by a Blue Bomb during the jump \u2b25 If you are far away post-jump, utilize Surge or Bladed Dive as soon as Vorago lands to avoid dragging additional bombs DPS/TL5 - Phase 4 Scopulus Pray Deflect Melee as soon as the phase starts and do not try to pray flick . You will receive heavy damage from nearby scopuli. \u2b25 Even though you are not required to Provoke any Scopulus, you should do so in case they start chasing one a Bomb Tank \u2b25 Initially, position in the south-western quadrant and stand near the crack on the floor (refer to the image below) \u2b25 Ultimate before the scopuli spawn and start attacking the eastern Scopulus \u2b25 Keep them stacked and prioritize AoE damage \u2b25 You may use Devotion after you are out of strong thresholds and special attacks (SWH , Dark Bow , Guthix Staff ) \u2b25 Once all have died, you can move to the nearest Bomb Tank to Resonance the last Blue Bomb \u2b25 1 DPS should drop a Combat Dummy as soon as 2 scopuli have died or at latest when the last one dies DPS/TL5 - Phase 5 Vitalis Every person in the team that is not a Bomb Tank must stand north-east of Vorago and in melee distance (MD). Vitalii can block you from moving, so if you are not in melee distance (MD) there is a chance of losing your Line of Sight, preventing you from using any offensive abilities. \u2b25 Use your SGB after Reflect if needed (or before if you are ranging) \u2b25 Ignore all Vitalis Orbs as well as all spawned vitali \u2b25 If Vorago happens to inflict bleeds , the Base, Bomb Tanks and TL5 will deal with them as usual \u2b25 For 4 man teams it is recommended to deal with Bleeds like this: Base (1 2), TL5 (3 4), BT (5) due to the TL5 being in melee distance (MD) Once the phase is finished, build to 100% on a Combat Dummy or an alive Vitalis. DPS/TL5 - Phase 6 Green Bomb \u2b25 Drop a Combat Dummy immediately as you drop into the phase \u2b25 DPS usually position centrally in the western half of the arena. \u2b25 For Mages - it is recommended to Sunshine (or Metamorphosis ) and apply Guthix Staff , followed by thresholds \u2b25 Rangers - should pre-ECB or only dump thresholds \u2b25 If both are available, utilize your Ingenuity of the Humans in combination with the Seren Godbow special attack in order to optimize your damage output pre-Reflect. If you receive a Green Bomb, simply stay close to another player and let it bounce off you. For 4 man you can let it bounce and then use your Powerburst of Vitality when it targets you a second time. Since the Bomb Tank provokes Vorago in this phase, you should not receive any additional damage, assuming proper positioning. DPS/TL5 - Phase 7 Team Split Team Split cancels all defensive abilities, including Disruption Shield . Make sure to eat well above 9,000 to avoid dying. \u2b25 Drop a Combat Dummy in the start of the phase, close to the edge of the arena \u2b25 Due to TS cancelling all defensive abilities, the optimal timing for Resonance is shortly after Reflect started (aiming to resonance the third or fourth Blue Bomb) \u2b25 Reprisal can be used if tanking the TS damage DPS/TL5 - Phase 8 The End \u2b25 Due to the Stand Up being skipped in most scenarios, avoid tagging any bombs \u2b25 Pre-ultimate before TC and use your strongest abilities \u2b25 Try to glitch out of arms if possible so you can Ultimate without having to move (due to Quadrants moving) \u2b25 In case a Stand Up happens, eat to full HP and use Disruption Shield and your Powerburst of Vitality (if either is available) \u2b25 Glitching out of arms Base Tank - Introduction Basing Hard Mode does not change much from Normal Mode. It is all about not moving the boss when it is not needed, and tanking hits without wasting food. Prayer flicking is also very useful to maintain HP without eating or using Resonance . Basing is usually performed by a meleer , who is also in charge of applying the Statius's Warhammer special attack throughout the fight. Range or Mage can be used just as well, but most strategies of this guide will focus on melee . If the Base Tank is not meleeing, a DPS should be in charge of applying SWH . Strategy Summary Base Tank - Phases 1 & 2 Base Tank - Phase 1 If not executing the described Solo Lure, perform the following steps. \u2b25 Move east of Vorago's spawn location as shown in the following clip \u2b25 Once Vorago spawns, use an ability and Provoke shortly after (within the ability's GCD) Note: It is important to not right away as if base vokes before the TL5 goes past the rock, they will lose aggro. \u2b25 Take Vorago close to the North-East corner \u2b25 Keep Vorago there until the climber reaches the final platform \u2b25 At roughly 30 seconds, or before the TL5 jumps the to the last ledge, head west quickly (take 1 or 2 steps followed by Surge ) \u2b25 Once the Top Lure voked Vorago into spot, position south in MD and Provoke (utilize Bladed Dive ) Base Tank - Phase 2 The Base Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to basing Normal Mode. During Phase 2 Bomb Tanks will deal with Red Bombs. Intercept is usually not needed for the base tank in P2. A Combat Dummy will be placed South once Bring Him Down is finished. Base Tank - Phases 3 - 8 Base Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings \u2b25 Optionally: Use Natural Instinct in Phase 2 after Bring Him Down \u2b25 Pre-ultimate and drink your adrenaline potion as you drop into Phase 3 \u2b25 Place a Combat Dummy towards an edge but far from both the middle and the wall \u2b25 Apply SWH soon as possible \u2b25 Since a Bomb Tank is supposed to voke this phase, the Base Tank should not do so in order to avoid melee auto attacks Base Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus The Base Tank's job in this Phase is to lure and stack all scopuli. Make sure the rest of the team is focusing them as well in case they go to the Bomb Tanks. A frequent usage of Vulnerability Bombs increases the probability of keeping all scopuli stacked. \u2b25 Stand directly west of the western Scopulus and throw a Vulnerability bomb 3 seconds before Target Cycle \u2b25 Once the scopuli are spawned, use one ability on the closest Scopulus, then target the eastern Scopulus and apply SWH \u2b25 Walk a few steps north and attack the northern Scopulus quickly \u2b25 Walk south-east to lure all scopuli and throw vuln bombs to keep them stacked \u2b25 Utilize Devotion once you start consuming too much food rapidly \u2b25 Avoid moving the scopuli more than required as it can lead them changing aggro. \u2b25 Once all scopuli are defeated, build adrenaline on the placed Combat Dummy Note: You should NOT be voking any scopuli unless they go for the Bomb tank. Hammering the western Scopulus is not recommended because it usually takes the heaviest damage, thence dying the fastest with or without SWH. Base Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis Base tank should position themselves in northeast md. \u2b25 If meleeing 4attack, pre-ultimate , otherwise use thresholds and special attacks \u2b25 Place a Combat Dummy at the start \u2b25 Apply SWH as soon as possible \u2b25 Utilize SGB right after Reflect if Vorago's life points are high (80k+) \u2b25 Ignore and avoid all Vitalis Orbs as well as any spawned vitalii \u2b25 Provoke Vorago shortly before the first Vitalis Orb explodes and avoid moving Vorago (do not leave MD) \u2b25 If Vorago happens to inflict bleeds , the Base, Bomb Tanks and TL5 will deal with them as usual Base Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb Base tank should remind Bomb tanks to voke if needed after dropdown. Do not revoke Vorago once his aggression is switched to avoid melee auto attacks. \u2b25 No ultimate is required, simply apply SWH and use thresholds \u2b25 A Combat Dummy will be placed on dropdown for the team to build adrenaline \u2b25 If Ingenuity of the Humans is ready, you may use SGB to optimize your damage pre-Reflect If you receive a Green Bomb, simply stay close to another DPS and let it bounce off you. For 4 man you can let it bounce and then use your Powerburst of Vitality when it targets you a second time. If the Green Bomb targets a Bomb Tank, heal them before it explodes. Base Tank - Phase 7 Team Split \u2b25 Apply SWH on Target Cycle \u2b25 Use thresholds for the rest of the phase. Reprisal the first Team Split if you managed to TC \u2b25 Provoke Vorago shortly before Reflect and stay MD (this saves the entire team quite some food) \u2b25 Exit the phase with enough adrenaline to activate Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 7 Base Tank - Phase 8 The End \u2b25 Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 7 \u2b25 Pre-ultimate and drink your adrenaline potion as you drop into Phase 8 \u2b25 Place a Combat Dummy in the start \u2b25 Apply SWH on TC and then build adrenaline with defensive abilities \u2b25 Use all your strong thresholds in the first quadrant and try to kill Vorago before Stand Up \u2b25 Utilize SGB and avoid being close to other players in case a Stand Up happens (also use your Powerburst of Vitality to boost survivability) Base Tank - Tips \u2b25 SWH EoF and Dragon Claws EoF are useful for optimal ability rotations \u2b25 Use Disruption Shield every time you can (Phase 2 during BHD, end of Phase 4 Scopulus, during Phase 7 Team Split, end of Phase 9 / start of Phase 10) \u2b25 Pre-ultimating and using Natural Instinct is not needed but significantly increases your contribution to progressing DPS phases quickly \u2b25 Performing a Solo Lure in Phase 1 is a massive QoL improvement for the entire team Bomb Tank - Introduction In Hard Mode Vorago throws 2 Blue Bombs at once, requiring a second Bomb Tank throughout the kill. Bomb Tanks will be referred to as BT1 and BT2. To perform this role, Intercept is required. BTs with knowledge of cept timings should split cepts before the hour begins. In case of using Heal Other , the Bomb Tanks always heal each other. Both BTs position south for most phases. Strategy Summary Bomb Tank - Phases 1 & 2 Bomb Tank - Phase 1 After the initial Red Bomb hits, build on Vorago and ultimate. Even if the team deals enough damage in time, utilizing an ultimate is yet recommended, in order to prevent excessive food usage. \u2b25 Activate Disruption Shield after the initial wave of reds dealt its 2,000 damage \u2b25 Afterwards, the person who devo cepted steps farther away to force the next Red Bomb on themselves \u2b25 If the phase takes long, Barricade Intercept can be useful \u2b25 Perform crack heals after every phase In case of a random Red Bomb, one of the Bomb Tanks should either devo or cade cept the targeted player. Additionally you should cast Heal Other whilst under the effect of Barricade. Bomb Tank - Phase 2 Phase 2 is mostly similar to Normal Mode. \u2b25 The Bomb Tanks should stand south of the boss at all times (also escape bleeds from the south) \u2b25 Only one BT will be responsible for taking the third and fourth Bleed \u2b25 BT1 cade cepts the first and third Red Bomb, BT2 cade cepts the second always intercept the Base Tank too \u2b25 Cast Heal Other during Barricade, situationally on the player with the lowest HP \u2b25 Place a Combat Dummy close to the south-western corner during Bring Him Down \u2b25 Activate Disruption Shield at the start of BHD Bomb Tank - Phases 3 - 8 Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings Both BTs stay north in this phase due to all others standing on the south side of the arena. \u2b25 Start the phase with thresholds and Provoke Vorago as soon as possible \u2b25 Watch out for the rock's landing location \u2b25 The team will spread out post-jump, be careful and avoid sharing bombs \u2b25 Use Surge / Bladed Dive carefully to get closer to Vorago post-jump, you always have to stay out the farthest in order to receive all bombs \u2b25 Devotion is not required but can be used if a Reflect occurs Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus In the beginning, go to the south-west corner and ultimate as shown in the image. Utilize your apot in this phase. \u2b25 Positioning in Phase 4 Scopulus \u2b25 Wait a few seconds before attacking the scopuli to avoid dragging aggression from the base tank \u2b25 You can use Disruption Shield to null a Blue Bomb, followed by Resonance if you need the HP \u2b25 BT1 should Devotion Intercept first, with the BT2 following up another 10 seconds of devo cept \u2b25 The intercepted person should use Soul Split until the effect wears off \u2b25 Rangers should bring Mechanized Chinchompas and mages should apply Guthix Staff (pair GStaff with a prior Greater Chain ) \u2b25 One of the Bomb Tanks should drop a Combat Dummy once the last Scopulus has died If a Scopulus switches aggression and starts running towards you, immediately run away until it is provoked off you (make use of Surge and Bladed Dive ). Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis Even though the meta used to require both BTs position in melee distance to Vorago throughout the entire phase, the most commonly used strategy is changed nowadays. \u2b25 Both Bomb Tanks stand out of melee distance for the whole phase to prevent Blue Bombs targeting other players and to avoid the need for prayer flicking \u2b25 Use thresholds and special attacks \u2b25 Do not use Resonance during Reflect if there are vitalii nearby as they may snipe its effect \u2b25 If needed, use your SGB after Reflect \u2b25 If Vorago happens to inflict bleeds , the Base, Bomb Tanks and TL5 will deal with them as usual Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb \u2b25 The BTs should position in the South \u2b25 One Bomb Tank provokes 2 - 3 GCDs after Target Cycle \u2b25 If Vorago switches his aggression, revoke in order to avoid melee auto attacks \u2b25 Rangers should activate ECB spec , mages should utilize Sunshine or Metamorphosis \u2b25 Apply SWH and use thresholds \u2b25 A Combat Dummy will be placed on dropdown for the team to build adrenaline \u2b25 If Ingenuity of the Humans is ready, you may use SGB to optimize your damage pre-Reflect If you receive a Green Bomb, eat up and use your Powerburst of Vitality . Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split You may use your Powerburst of Vitality if it is available in order to improve health management when using Reprisal during a Team Split. \u2b25 Provoke Vorago as soon as the first Team Split ends \u2b25 The Base Tank will provoke during Reflect - do not revoke after this \u2b25 A Bomb Tank should use Devotion Intercept right after the second Team Split \u2b25 Drop a Combat Dummy during Reflect or during the second TS Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End The goal is to skip the Stand Up and avoid tagging any bombs. \u2b25 Ultimate pre-TC and dump the strongest abilities you have available \u2b25 If a Stand Up happens, eat to full life points and utilize your Powerburst of Vitality (if it is not on CD) Weekly Special Mechanics - Phases 9, 10 & 11 Overview Phase 9 This section will be split into a regular Phase 9 and a Phase 9 with Clone Skip. The strategies only change for Green Bomb. Bomb Tanks will take turns to Barricade and Intercept the team for each cycle. Make sure to designate who is going to first. If Clone Skip fails, everyone must get closer to Vorago as soon as possible: DPS goes 2-3 steps away from Vorago and BTs at their usual distance. Ceilings BTs must and everyone when Vorago makes the animation to launch the rock. Also, if you are not responsible for bleeds , you should help the team to clear the rocks asap after you are . Scopulus It is dealt with in the same way as Phase 2. One BT will step further from rago and the other will and . Vitalis \u2b25 Right before Vorago launches the Vitalis orb, one Bomb Tank will and everyone while going to the orb too. For the clone skip one, the BTs will alternate with the and . \u2b25 The DPS should help the team to clear the that spawned. In order to do that, you can deploy dominion mines before they spawn and use AoE abilities on them. \u2b25 For the regular Phase 9, the whole team should be at the NE quadrant and the BTs on the E or N quadrant; but for the Clone Skip, the orb will be thrown in a random direction. Green Bomb \u2b25 Regular Phase 9: BTs must build to 100% before the Green Bomb is launched. After the green targets one person, one BT should and them. \u2b25 Clone Skip Phase 9: Both BTs should build to 100% for the first green and deal with it as normal. For the second green, the Base must also build to 100% to and the BT. If the green is on one of the DPS, the BT with off cooldown will and . Team Split The BTs will and everyone after the team split. The End \u2b25 BT 1 will be responsible for tagging reds and BT 2 will and them. It is important that everyone either glitches out of arms or stays MD while this is done, to avoid receiving damage from red. The BT that tags must also go to the wall as soon as possible to avoid sharing Red Bombs. \u2b25 After that, BT 1 will build to 100% asap and will and everyone right before the stand up of Vorago. Following that, the BT, who is 'd (BT 2), should move away so the red goes to him. \u2b25 If there are Ranger + Mage BTs, it is preferable that the Range BT uses and the Mage BT that will tag the reds. \u2b25 Before the last Waterfall, whoever is mauling must have Piece (a) and Piece (b) in their inventory. Make sure to grab the Piece (c) and make the maul before Phase 10 starts. \u2b25 One of the BT must drop a dummy at the end of this phase, preferably during the last waterfall and close to the middle. Phase 10 and 11 Overview The strategies for the 6 rotations can be summarised into two methods: the safe method and the fast or advanced method. For the Phase 10 and 11 sections, all the DPS must place their ultimates in melee distance. Whenever an ultimate is mentioned, it is already implied that it should be place in md. \u2b25 Bomb Tanks will always split sides: one BT North (usually the one that ultimates) and the other BT South (DPS side) \u2b25 Both BTs must use Disruption Shield in Phase 9 when Vorago dies for Scopulus, Vitalis, Green Bomb and The End. This is done to block the first blue in Phase 10 and then Barricade (if needed) the second one. For Phase 11, BTs and DPS should use when it is available \u2b25 If BTs do not have active at the same time, the pushback from the blue will not be nullified \u2b25 For 4 man teams the Base and TL5 will take a side too. Base usually goes South and TL5 North. This is only helpful on rotations with Green Bomb and Purple Bomb, as it is easier to tank the specials without having to move from the team Safe Method It requires everyone to Ultimate on dropdown except for one of the Bomb Tanks. The other BT will use a threshold or two (depending on adrenaline management), and then build to 100% to . The first blue should be blocked by , giving more time to build to Barricade. In the next phase, the BT that used will now build to ultimate and vice versa. Advanced Method Requires everyone to Ultimate except for one BT (South) that will use all the strong thresholds and special attacks available. This is done to help with the push, usually referred to as 0-Link (zero link), to avoid having to use . This method is not recommended on a team with multiple learners. The reason why only one of the BT will Ultimate is because the damage needed to push should be enough from the rest of the team's Ultimates and the BT thresholds. This way the BT that didn't Ultimate can do so in Phase 11 The safe method is not considered a common strategy anymore (as it aims for less damage and a longer phase), but it is still recommended when there are multiple learners in the team. The fast (advanced) method relies on the team pushing Vorago non-stop, but on a team with low damage it is hard to do so without a set rotation. Phase 10 In addition to the two methods, there are also some things to point out for some rotations. Make sure to also read about Broken Team Splits below, because it is a bug that happens on every rotation that has as the second special. Ceilings & Team Split Avoid using before the phase starts because team split cancels defensives and . Save it for after the team split regardless of what method the team is using. If is used for the team split special, make sure to use it after the team split and not before the special. This also applies to Scopulus and Green Bomb. Ceilings, Scopulus, Vitalis, & The End The DPS must step back to block the Vitalis orb in Phase 10 and 11. Make sure to not go further than Bomb Tanks, to avoid sharing Blue Bombs with each other. For the safe method, one of the BT will and the whole team before the Vitalis orb is launched. BTs will rotate for each cycle if needed. Green Bomb Deal with the Green Bomb as usual. If it is on a Bomb Tank, they should use their Vitality potion . Optional: If the Bomb Tank's HP is too low, the Base Tank can heal them before the green hits. If it is on the DPS, eat up and let it bounce amongst the pile. Tank it (with ) on your side of the arena if it is a 4 man team. The right timing must be used to ensure a consistent Phase 11. Read below for the timings. At the end of the arena in Phase 10, and before it is mauled, the BT should drop a to build at the start of the next phase. This is even more helpful with a Shield Dome maul , explained below. Broken Team Split Specials marked with a red font represent a broken Team Split. You will notice that it is always going to happen when Team Split is the second special in Phase 10 or 11. A broken Team Split is one where Vorago is able to throw autos (Melee or Blue Bombs) while charging the team split. The best way to reduce the damage from these is to not attack Vorago at all after the Reflect ends. If you get autos during a broken team split, simply Pray Deflect Magic , go to your colour box and eat up. Make sure to go closer to Vorago as soon as the Team Split explodes, otherwise you will drag more Blue Bombs into the DPS pile. Mauling Phase 10 Mauling phase 10 is typically the TL5's job, unless the base is meleeing - this is because a melee base would always be in MD and will be able to at the right time. The timing for the is important because it determines what happens at the start of Phase 11. You must always wait for the special to be released before mauling, otherwise Vorago will start the next phase with it instead of Auto Attacks. If we take the example of Scopulus week, Vorago's rotation for phases 10 and 11 are as follows: \u2b25 Phase 10: Purple Bomb release \u2192 5 Attacks \u2192 Reflect (for 3 Attacks) \u2192 3 Attacks \u2192 Team Split \u2192 3 Attacks \u2b25 Phase 11: Purple Bomb release \u2192 5 Attacks \u2192 Reflect (for 3 Attacks) \u2192 3 Attacks \u2192 Vitalis orb \u2192 3 Attacks If you maul in Phase 10 after 2 Attacks have been released, Vorago has 3 remaining Attacks in his rotation (because in Phase 10, there are a total of 5 autos before the Reflect). At the start of Phase 11, he would perform these 3 autos before continuing with his rotation, and going into reflect. If you mauled 4 Attacks autos after purple release at the start of Phase 10, there would be 1 remaining Attack. This means that Phase 11 would begin with 1 auto before going into Reflect. This leads to a high chance of killing other people as people attempt to DPS at the start of the phase. If you are unsure of how many Attacks have been fired, it is better to keep Vorago in the spot and when reflect starts. In summary, there are 3 times to that are optimal for the kill, as they maximise the number of Attacks in Phase 11 before the next special: \u2b25 #1: When the first special begins \u2b25 #2 When Reflect starts \u2b25 #3: When the second special begins Mauling as soon as Reflect starts is good for all rotations, but it is not the best option. While this can seem complicated at first, mauling at the right time makes the kill easier because you do not have to calculate how many autos remain from the Phase 10 rotation before the next special will occur in Phase 11. The following chart shows all the possible timings for each rotation, and they assume the occurred as soon as the special started, with no autos in between the special release and the . If you get more than 2 autos after a Special, go to the next timing as it is best to skip the first timing to optimize the amount of Attacks on the next phase. Shield Dome Mauling This is a strategy that allows you to skip the animation in Phase 10. It does not save time but allows everyone to build on the dummy while Vorago is still talking. It is done by using Shield Dome before clicking the maul while Vorago is in the spot. do not spam clicking your or the , otherwise it will not work. Phase 11 This phase is dealt with in the same way as Phase 10, and following the same descriptions in the Overview above, The Bomb Tank that used Barricade in Phase 10 should now build to Ultimate and the other BT should build to Barricade . Depending on the push, it might be better for BTs to Ultimate and threshold respectively. Only use Barricade for one of the specials in Phase 11.

Introduction Hard Mode Vorago (HM) is a variant of Vorago where the fight is extended from 5 to 11 phases, of which only phases 9 to 11 depend on the weekly rotation. Knowledge of all the Normal Mode (NM) rotations as well as Reflect timings are essential when learning this mode. Strategies do not vary from 4 - 7 man, thence the recommended team size is 5 . \u2b25 This guide will be separated into roles, combat styles and skill levels - It will not cover DPS rotations by any means \u2b25 This guide focuses on transferring and adapting gained knowledge from NM to HM, rather than explaining mechanics and role responsibilities from scratch \u2b25 Most warnings and specific comments can be found in the DPS section and will not be repeated for other roles \u2b25 After each phase finishes, you are supposed to build to 100% adrenaline for the next phase (usually the team coordinates dummies for each phase) The first section of this guide explains every phase and how to deal with it using general strategies. Every phase will have the respective attack order and relevant mechanics. This section will also treat TL5 as a DPS: the DPS strategies and responsibilities will be explained only. This section covers phases 1 - 8. The second section is dedicated to tank roles. The Base Tank section is applicable to all styles, but the recommended combat style is melee . The Bomb Tank section is applicable to ranged and mage , with the only differences being the use of ultimates . This section covers phases 1 - 8. The last section explains phases 9 - 11 depending on the weekly special mechanic and is split into all 6 rotations with roles and their respective responsibilities.

The other BT will use a threshold or two (depending on adrenaline management), and then build to 100% to . The first blue should be blocked by , giving more time to build to Barricade. In the next phase, the BT that used will now build to ultimate and vice versa. Advanced Method Requires everyone to Ultimate except for one BT (South) that will use all the strong thresholds and special attacks available. This is done to help with the push, usually referred to as 0-Link (zero link), to avoid having to use . This method is not recommended on a team with multiple learners. The reason why only one of the BT will Ultimate is because the damage needed to push should be enough from the rest of the team's Ultimates and the BT thresholds. This way the BT that didn't Ultimate can do so in Phase 11 The safe method is not considered a common strategy anymore (as it aims for less damage and a longer phase), but it is still recommended when there are multiple learners in the team. The fast (advanced) method relies on the team pushing Vorago non-stop, but on a team with low damage it is hard to do so without a set rotation.","title":"Phase 10 and 11 Overview"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-hardmode/#phase-10","text":"In addition to the two methods, there are also some things to point out for some rotations.

Ceilings, Scopulus, Vitalis, & The End The DPS must step back to block the Vitalis orb in Phase 10 and 11. Make sure to not go further than Bomb Tanks, to avoid sharing Blue Bombs with each other. For the safe method, one of the BT will and the whole team before the Vitalis orb is launched. BTs will rotate for each cycle if needed. Green Bomb Deal with the Green Bomb as usual. If it is on a Bomb Tank, they should use their Vitality potion . Optional: If the Bomb Tank's HP is too low, the Base Tank can heal them before the green hits.

You will notice that it is always going to happen when Team Split is the second special in Phase 10 or 11. A broken Team Split is one where Vorago is able to throw autos (Melee or Blue Bombs) while charging the team split. The best way to reduce the damage from these is to not attack Vorago at all after the Reflect ends. If you get autos during a broken team split, simply Pray Deflect Magic , go to your colour box and eat up. Make sure to go closer to Vorago as soon as the Team Split explodes, otherwise you will drag more Blue Bombs into the DPS pile.","title":"Phase 10"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-hardmode/#mauling-phase-10","text":"Mauling phase 10 is typically the TL5's job, unless the base is meleeing - this is because a melee base would always be in MD and will be able to at the right time. The timing for the is important because it determines what happens at the start of Phase 11. You must always wait for the special to be released before mauling, otherwise Vorago will start the next phase with it instead of Auto Attacks. If we take the example of Scopulus week, Vorago's rotation for phases 10 and 11 are as follows: \u2b25 Phase 10: Purple Bomb release \u2192 5 Attacks \u2192 Reflect (for 3 Attacks) \u2192 3 Attacks \u2192 Team Split \u2192 3 Attacks \u2b25 Phase 11: Purple Bomb release \u2192 5 Attacks \u2192 Reflect (for 3 Attacks) \u2192 3 Attacks \u2192 Vitalis orb \u2192 3 Attacks If you maul in Phase 10 after 2 Attacks have been released, Vorago has 3 remaining Attacks in his rotation (because in Phase 10, there are a total of 5 autos before the Reflect). At the start of Phase 11, he would perform these 3 autos before continuing with his rotation, and going into reflect. If you mauled 4 Attacks autos after purple release at the start of Phase 10, there would be 1 remaining Attack. This means that Phase 11 would begin with 1 auto before going into Reflect. This leads to a high chance of killing other people as people attempt to DPS at the start of the phase. If you are unsure of how many Attacks have been fired, it is better to keep Vorago in the spot and when reflect starts. In summary, there are 3 times to that are optimal for the kill, as they maximise the number of Attacks in Phase 11 before the next special: \u2b25 #1: When the first special begins \u2b25 #2 When Reflect starts \u2b25 #3: When the second special begins Mauling as soon as Reflect starts is good for all rotations, but it is not the best option. While this can seem complicated at first, mauling at the right time makes the kill easier because you do not have to calculate how many autos remain from the Phase 10 rotation before the next special will occur in Phase 11. The following chart shows all the possible timings for each rotation, and they assume the occurred as soon as the special started, with no autos in between the special release and the . If you get more than 2 autos after a Special, go to the next timing as it is best to skip the first timing to optimize the amount of Attacks on the next phase.

These tips can range from very helpful (to the point where dps strategies rely on them) to just knowing them for the sake of trivia. These are generally organized by phase. Some of this information is already listed on the RS Wiki but for the sake of completion I will reiterate them here. This is not an extensive list of all glitches and misc. tips as I\u2019m sure there are more to be discovered. Unless stated otherwise, all of these apply to both normal mode and hard mode. Pre-Fight Challenge Timer \u2b25 Vorago\u2019s fight challenge operates on a timer of 20 seconds. If you teleport away after you\u2019ve accepted Vorago\u2019s challenge to fight, and you travel back to the Face area within the 20 seconds, Vorago will still start the encounter and bring everyone into P1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If you teleport away, do not return to the Face area within 20 seconds unless you wish to join the fight. Fake Dropdown \u2b25 There are some methods wherein you can take the dropdown damage but not enter the fight. One method of doing so is to open the \u201cchange username\u201d interface, though you do not need to change your username \u2013 just have the interface open. The dropdown damage will still calculate as if you will join the fight (eg. In a team of five, the dropdown damage will be 10k even though only four people enter the kill). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: This could be used to lessen dropdown damage without having to enter p1 and lobby thereafter, in the event you need to get someone with low HP into the fight. Rest Animation \u2b25 If you are in a rest animation when someone initiates the fight challenge prompt, you will not receive the challenge prompt until you have left the rest animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Don\u2019t accidentally not accept the challenge prompt by resting at Face. Lucky and Dropdown Damage \u2b25 The Lucky perk can proc on the dropdown damage. Defenders and Armor set effects such as the Saradomin Warpriest effect can also proc on the dropdown damage nulling it to 1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Get lucky and take 1 damage instead of 12500. This is unlikely to be useful for regular kills however. Powerburst of Vitality \u2b25 Dropdown is 20 seconds after challenge, so you can time using the powerburst of vitality by using a defensive ability like Preparation. Then right when it has some time before it comes back, you can use the powerburst right then to start the fight with more health than if you just used a phoenix necklace. You can also bring only one dose if you don't need it for the rest of the kill so you can equip your 2h weapons without needing to eat something else. Tutorial on 14k Entry Hits Order to Maximize HP Bonfire with all of your HP-boosting gear; if you have a thermal flask, use it prior to bonfiring Load your preset with your shield equipped Activate Fortitude Eat a rocktail/sailfish soup Lobby You should be 14k+ hp without needing to keep prayer activated, just don't take off any hp boosting items (e.g. shield) or load another preset, else your hp disappears Phase 1 Less Bombs on P1 \u2b25 Once the TL5 reaches the top rock and vokes Vorago, Vorago will throw less auto attacks and often have a longer delay between auto attacks, provided no one else is standing in MD (ie. Base should not voke and stand MD until around 30k hp). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: In trios, this lessens the number of blues and red bombs the Bomb Tank has to take during P1 TL5 Corner and Attack Range \u2b25 Assuming the Base lures Vorago to the North West quadrant so that the TL5 takes bombs as he climbs to the voke spot, the far North West corner of the TL5 path is often too far away from Vorago\u2019s attack range. Thus, if the TL5 spends too long in the corner of the North West section, Vorago will start throwing bombs to the next furthest person which is usually the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: The TL5 should run past the North West corner as fast as possible to avoid sending bombs to the Bomb Tank in trios. How to Lobby P1 \u2b25 If the TL5 is standing on the top platform and vokes Vorago, the rest of the team can run to the South wall and exit combat to lobby. Vorago may throw occasionally throw blue bombs to the people running Southward, though, he will do it so infrequently that you should still be able to lobby in between blue bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Lobby p1 if someone dies and you don\u2019t want to invest more to further the kill. Jump Damage Null \u2b25 Upon the TL5 clicking to jump on Vorago, all incoming damage will be nulled on the tick when the TL5 clicks to jump. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If Vorago is close to HP reset and the TL5 sees someone doing a wild magic that will reset the HP, the TL5 can click to jump and immediately null any incoming damage, preventing an HP reset. TL5 Staying in Combat \u2b25 The jump animation is exactly 17 seconds. As the TL5, it is possible to stay in combat during the jump animation. This requires the TL5 to do an ability on the tick you click to jump. If you do an ability and wait a couple ticks before jump, you will have exited combat and lost adren during the jump animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: This is a way for the TL5 to keep adren during jump and threshold after jump to end p1 faster. Movement After Jump \u2b25 If the Base moves away from MD during the jump animation, Vorago will follow the Base as if Vorago is still in MD. However, Vorago will not visibly move as he is stuck in the jump animation. After the jump animation is over and the TL5 reaches the ground, Vorago\u2019s character will \u201cteleport\u201d to be MD of where-ever the Base has walked to. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: In duos, the Base can escape during the jump animation. If the Bomb/TL5 happens to have a red bomb on them, the red bomb won\u2019t deal 3k damage as the Base is far enough away. Be sure to walk one step north after you\u2019ve escaped to prevent Vorago from moonwalking around the Base. \u2b25 After Vorago has moved to the Base\u2019s MD post-jump, Vorago will not move from that location unless the Base steps under him. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If no one is standing MD, Vorago will continue to throw blue bombs to the Bomb Tank. The Base can step away from Vorago\u2019s MD and devo-cept the Bomb Tank. 1 HP Glitch \u2b25 Vorago will regenerate HP on phase 1 at 1:09 (also 2:09, 3:09, etc.), if Vorago regenerates HP while jumping around before the phase transition, Vorago can have random aggro at the start of p2 meaning the first bleed on p2 will also be to a random person. Vorago can also start throwing blues and potentially reds. The blue and red bombs can follow you through the phase transition damage you upon p2 dropdown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: The Base should target cycle as soon as possible on p2 to ensure that Base has aggro on p2.

You can take advantage of this by using the spell Heal Other from the Lunar Spellbook and cast the heal at the same time as a phase transition. Normally, Heal Other will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target player; this results in a large 3-7k typeless \"hit\" on your character that is unavoidable. However, as your character is immune during a phase transition, the Heal Other will not damage your character. Thus, your target player will gain hp at no cost to you. This works on any phase transition at Vorago in both normal mode and hard mode (with the exception of p10 -> p11 at hard mode). How to Perform a Crack Heal \u2b25 Be on the Lunar Spellbook and select the spell Heal Other. \u2b25 Click your target player when the floor shows cracks, right before it collapses. \u2b25 Important Notes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Your target player must have Accept Aid turned ON in their settings. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you mess up and perform the Heal Other too early/late, the spell will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Heal Group can be used as well, though it requires your target player(s) to be within 1 square of you. Easiest way to achieve this is to ask your partner to follow you, or vice versa. See video for examples: https://youtu.be/3bMTu1YJIbQ Phase 2 Invisible First Bleed \u2b25 The first bleed of P2 does not have a character animation as Vorago is still in his dropdown animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Clear the first bleed by using freedom first, then tag and voke if you are the Base. 1 Tick Bleed Clear \u2b25 It is possible to clear the bleed in 1 tick by first escaping, then bladed diving back onto Vorago within the same tick. You must target Vorago with the bladed dive, targeting the ground for MD will not work and will make Vorago walk towards you. You must avoid standing on the corner of Vorago\u2019s MD as this will also make Vorago walk toward you after you\u2019ve escaped. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: This is another way to keep Vorago in Base spot while clearing bleeds without freedom. Instant Bleed Clear \u2b25 After a bleed is applied, there is a couple ticks delay between when the bleed is applied to when the dismember icon appears on the debuff bar. It is possible to clear a bleed before the dismember bleed icon appears on your debuff bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: You can clear bleeds faster than you think. Voke Splash \u2b25 It is possible to have a voke splash on P2, and (likely) all other phases of the boss too. If a player vokes Vorago and another player is standing within the path of Vorago and the voker, Vorago will aggro onto the person standing in-between instead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Avoid voking Vorago while standing behind another player. See clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/FrigidDeafMooseThisIsSparta Clearing All Bleeds Solo \u2b25 It is possible to clear all five bleeds solo. The order is escape/surge, bladed dive, freedom, escape/surge, bladed dive. Note a mobile perk is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Clear all five bleeds solo in case of dead teammates. 2k Typeless Damage \u2b25 Sometimes, after Bring Him Down, all players in the arena will take a 2k typeless hit immediately after the spam click mechanic. It is unclear what triggers this though it is believe to be an \u201canti-afk\u201d where if players ignore Vorago for too long, Vorago will perform the 2k typeless hit (similar to how you must stay in combat in Yaka). This 2k typeless hit can also be encountered during P1 if the TL5 vokes Vorago and everyone else lobbies, but the TL5 stays in the kill and exits combat. The TL5 will proceed to take 2k typeless hits. It seems the entire team must exit combat for this bleed to occur, though confirmation on this is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Keep above 2k HP after Bring Him Down just in case. Stuck Under Vorago \u2b25 During Bring Him Down, it is possible to get stuck under Vorago after the spam click mechanic. This is usually triggered by standing under Vorago during the Bring Him Down mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Avoid standing under Vorago during Bring Him Down. Bring Him Down \u2013 DPS Check \u2b25 The Bring Him Down DPS check to make Vorago stumble is 50k Hp no matter the team size. This is rather trivial to do in a team size of 3+ but becomes harder in Duos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Do approx. 50k worth of damage during Bring Him Down to get past the mechanic. Bring Him Down \u2013 Staying in Combat \u2b25 Occasionally, it is possible to exit combat and drop adren during the Bring Him Down spam click mechanic. This usually occurs when players have refreshed their combat state before the last Gravity Orb is tagged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: To avoid dropping combat and losing adren during Bring Him Down, do a defensive ability during the spam click mechanic, such as anticipate. Centring Vorago (Courtesy of #Ry and #Foxis) Knowing how to walk Vorago is useful for moving him on phase 2. First determine his walking direction. Step one tile under Vorago and immediately cast an ability to walk him one tile in his walking direction. Note: If you do not cast an ability he may walk on top of you and around to the other side. Once you determine Vorago's walking direction, it is easiest to manipulate his position from the opposite side, i.e. if Vorago is walking west, stand on the east side of him. In order to move Vorago, he must be following you. During phase 2, Vorago does not follow between the red bomb and start of bleeds. This means if you step out of melee distance expecting Vorago to follow you after the red, he will stand there until bleeds begin. However, he can be walked under which will cause him to move in the direction he is walking. If Vorago is walking south, go west and bladed dive onto the square marked with the blue blubber jellyfish To bring Vorago back to base spot when vorago is lured south during bleeds, step 2 squares north of the square west of L rock and provoke If Vorago is north, step 2 squares south instead. How to Tick Shatter After Bring Him Down (Courtesy of #Tho mas) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXqNT7XOOHk&feature=youtu.be Phase 3 Scopulus \u2013 Aggro \u2b25 The Scopulus aggro seem to be random though there are a couple ways to trigger a reaggro. 1) If a player is constantly in motion, the Scopulus tend to aggro them more. 2) A player with an Ice Nihil will tend to draw more aggro, due to the Ice Nihil\u2019s special effect acting on the Scops. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Bring a Smoke Nihil on Scop rotations to avoid drawing aggro. Vitalis \u2013 Base Spot and Vitalis Spawn \u2b25 If Vorago is not moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb will always be sent North, North East, or East. If Vorago is moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb can be send in any direction. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Avoid moving Vorago to have a predictable Vitalis Orb spawn. Vitalis \u2013 Max Vitalis \u2b25 The maximum number of Vitalis that can fill the room in Normal Mode is 15, the max in Hard Mode is 25. In Normal Mode, the number of Vitalis spawning per Orb is 5 on p3 and p4, and 2-4 on p5. In Hard Mode, there are 7 Vitalis on p5 and p9, and between 3 to 5 on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: If you want to block all Vitalis spawns, have the appropriate number of people standing in the spawn Orb. Vitalis \u2013 Death Animation \u2b25 A Vitalis minion is still treated as a physical object while in its death animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If surrounded by Vitali, be vary of their death animations still counting as a physical object. Same applies to Waterfall on P4, your character will attempt to path around the dying Vitalis which may lead to exiting the waterfall prematurely. See clip: https://youtu.be/-HOB3kLpHgI Teamsplit \u2013 Auto Attacks \u2b25 During the teamsplit mechanic, if you attempt to cast an auto attack on Vorago while outside the max cast distance, your character will run into the max cast distance in an attempt to cast your spell. Often times this results in a player leaving the teamsplit box early and taking 8k damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Do not attempt to auto cast while in teamsplit unless you are certain you are within 7 squares to Vorago. Teamsplit \u2013 Hard Mode \u2b25 The teamsplit boxes in hardmode, although appearing to be only 1x1, are actually 1x2. The square directly east of the 1x1 square is also safe to stand on. The same applies to the teamsplit boxes on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Another safe square to stand on for team split. The End \u2013 Glitch Out of Arms \u2b25 It is possible to glitch out of the arms during the mechanic by standing directly on the South line, or East line, in the respective quadrants. When Vorago\u2019s arm crosses said line, your character is free to move out into the open arena. Note that if you do not move after \u201cglitching out\u201d and stay standing on the South or East line, you will be forced back into the arms mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: DPS can glitch out of arms and set up their Sun with ample space. The End \u2013 Bombs after Phase \u2b25 Vorago only allows bombs to be interacted with when it is pointed to in their respective quadrant. If Vorago happens to phase while looking at a specific quadrant, the bombs in that quadrant can still be activated while the phase transition is happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Tag the red bombs during a phase transition and ask for a group hug. How to DD Scops on Spawn Using Backwards Target Cycle https://youtu.be/KmYgKcfLeRc Getting Flank on Scops as Base (Courtesy of #Archeus) Stand on the tile shown in the video, and take one step north east after luring scops. https://youtu.be/UtBBbOpRx84 (Clip courtesy of #NamoV) Phase 4 Waterfall \u2013 First Spawn \u2b25 The first spawn of the waterfall will never be on the North East corner of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: That is one less corner you have to consider for waterfall upon dropdown. Waterfall \u2013 Auto Attacks \u2b25 Initiating an auto attack while standing in waterfall will force your character to run into max cast distance and often outside of the waterfall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Avoid using auto attacks on Vorago while standing in waterfall. Waterfall \u2013 Corners of the Waterfall \u2b25 The corners of the waterfall (excluding the NE, SE, NW, SW corner) are not considered part of the waterfall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Avoid standing on the edge/corners of the waterfall or else be ready to take a 9800 hit. Stone Clone \u2013 Vorago Melee Animation \u2b25 Upon summoning a stone clone, Vorago will perform a melee swipe animation. This melee swipe animation is non-damaging and is only cosmetic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Do not try to res this attack as it won\u2019t hit anything. Stone Clone \u2013 No Target \u2b25 If the stone clone target dies on the same tick, or shortly after the stone clone spawns, the stone clone will stand idle for a couple seconds before reaggroing to another person. However, the new player cannot attack the stone clone back as they are not the stone clones\u2019 original target. The stone clone will eventually despawn. Teamsplit \u2013 Third Waterfall \u2b25 The teamsplit mechanic after the third waterfall is currently glitched. Vorago is still attackable during the teamsplit and if attacked, Vorago will proceed with his rotation and throw three blues, followed by bleeds. This means the team will have to tank 3 blues without any defensives and be ready to immediately deal with bleeds out of team split. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: DO NOT ATTACK Vorago as teamsplit is about to spawn. This prevents Vorago from sending blues during the teamsplit. Stone Clone Skip (Courtesy of #Foxis and #Durmoth) Introduction A Stone Clone in Phase 4 / 9 always targets a person that Vorago does not hold aggression towards (the Base Tank). In other words, the Base Tank never receives a Stone Clone. It has been discovered in scenarios where you end in a Solo Phase 4, that Vorago will bug for a few ticks and then proceed with the weekly special, skipping the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks completely. In place of creating the Stone Clone, Vorago bugs for 12 ticks and skips all 7 auto attacks which equates to a total of 56 ticks (33.6s) saved. Overview \u2b25 One player vokes , underwalks Vorago and lures him to whatever wall he's walking towards. \u2b25 All other players quickly position at the opposite side of the arena, so that they leave the visibility range to Vorago. \u2b25 Due to the Base Tank being the only visible player in the arena, Vorago will skip the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks. \u2b25 Vorago will continue his attack order with the weekly special mechanic. Strategy \u2b25 Toggle off running once you enter the Waterfall. \u2b25 Post-Waterfall: Either use Barge as your first ability or Surge within your first ability's GCD Note: On Team Split, use the Mobile perk with gBarge if you plan on breaking the TS. \u2b25 Walk towards Vorago's walking direction (do not run). \u2b25 Toggle on running as Vorago reaches the wall. \u2b25 The moment that Vorago starts moving, all other players should immediately position at the opposite side of Vorago's walking direction (utilise Surge and Bladed Dive ). \u2b25 Once the Stone Clone special mechanic is skipped, move back to the Base Tank Video Example (Courtesy of #XTL) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maGhYnPa92w Important Notes Due to the incredible amount of time gained by a Clone Skip, Barricade will mostly no longer be available for each weekly special mechanic. Due to this it is required to alternate Barricades between the Base and Bomb Tank. Preferably the Bomb Tank barricades the first cycle so that it will be ready in case of a Phase 5 / 10 Barricade. Breaking Teamsplits (Courtesy of #XTL) \u201cBreaking\u201d a teamsplit involves Vorago continuing his attack rotation during a teamsplit. This is beneficial during phase 4, as it can speed up the phase. However, this is harmful on phases 3 and 5, as it gives you less time to attack the boss. When the teamsplit is broken, Vorago can still use both melee attacks and blue bombs, so keep in mind to eat up if necessary to not die to this. How to Break TS \u2b25 You need to use mutated barge and then apply one of your melee channeled abilities as a bleed directly before the teamsplit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It does not matter which ability you use (flurry, assault, or destroy), however the tick that you apply the bleed on DOES effect how quickly the teamsplit is broken. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Some ticks result in attacks starting slower during the teamsplit, meaning the phases lasts longer, where others result in the attacks starting sooner in teamsplit, meaning the phase doesn\u2019t last as long. \u200e \u200eA consistent way break the teamsplit on a fast tick is to barge immediately after the 6th blue bomb is released after the clone and then bleed destroy exactly one global cooldown later. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Keep in mind to stop attacking before your barge to get the buff. If done correctly, bleeds will come immediately after a phase 4 teamsplit. The first bleed received is somewhat invisible, similar to the first bleed on phase 2, so make sure to watch out for that. In addition, you can sometimes lose aggro, so make sure to voke. Both barge and the bleed following can splash and you will still break the teamsplit. Video example of a slow vs fast broken teamsplit (left side is the correct timing): https://youtu.be/5MMV0_JraMw Phase 5 Walking MD \u2013 Revo Friendly \u2b25 A player can spam click the ground behind Vorago to make their character stand MD while also stopping revo from attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Good for revo users to MD and be ready to clear bleeds on tick. P5 Voke \u2b25 Due to how P5 is set up, a player cannot voke Vorago during p5. The ability will simply not activate when pressed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: None. Melee Dismember on Reflects \u2b25 If a player applies the dismember melee ability on reflects to another player, and the victim player receives the first bleed, the first bleed damage will immediately apply the 4500 damage as if the player was taking a second bleed from Vorago without clearing the first bleed. This is most likely an oversight. It is unknown if this works on p2, p3, and p4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Prank your teammates by putting a dismember on them during reflects. P5 Pushback Stall and Auto Attacks \u2b25 Vorago begins his attack pattern the tick after the target cycle tick. His attack speed varies: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 His attack speed will be 4 ticks if the last action he performed was either being pushed forwards or being pushed back \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 His attack speed will be 3 ticks if the last action he performed was attacking, whether it be a special attack, blue bomb, or melee swipe. This includes if he pushes and attacks in the same tick. \u2b25 As you can attack Vorago on the target cycle tick, which is before he releases the first spec, you can delay the release of the first special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: 0-Linking green bomb/vitalis; 0-Specing \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago can only be pushed once in either direction on any given tick. Damaged Required to Push Pushing Vorago one tile entails dealing 20k damage to him. As soon as this 20k threshold is hit, the damage counter resets to 0 for the next tile. \u2b25 Example A: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you deal one hit of damage that deals 30k damage to Vorago, 30k damage is added to the damage counter, then the game performs a check to see if that total value is at least 20k. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It finds that 30,000 >= 20,000 holds true, so Vorago pushes a tile and then the counter is reset to 0, effectively losing 10,000 damage. This 10,000 damage is referred to as \u201coverkill\u201d. \u2b25 Example B: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Presume you deal three individual hits of 10,000 damage on the same tick. The first one is added to the damage counter, it checks if 10,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is false, so that hit doesn\u2019t cause it to push. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The next hit is then added to the damage counter, which is now at 20,000 damage. It checks if 20,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is true, so the boss pushes and resets the damage counter to 0. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Finally, the last hit of 10,000 is added to the damage counter, and it performs the same check, but finds that 10,000 >= 20,000 does not hold true. This 10,000 damage stays in the damage counter until the next tick, and this damage is referred to as \u201coverflow\u201d. So the result of these hits is pushing one tile with 10,000 overflow. \u2b25 Example C: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Suppose there is one last hit of 10,000 damage on that tick. Again, this 10,000 is added to the damage counter as before, for a total of 20,000 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The game performs the same check and finds that 20,000 is in fact at least 20,000, so the damage counter resets. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago cannot be pushed twice on the same tick, so hitting this 40,000 damage mark in one tick may actively be detrimental to a kill, as you will end up losing 20,000 damage. Skipping Debilitate on P5 (Courtesy of #Foxis) Debilitate should be skipped after bleeds because while it does have a chance of blocking push back, it can negatively impact stall. This is most notable on the TeamSplit rotation because the person who suns relies heavily on stall to use their threshes before TeamSplit. While this is not as harmful on other rotations, it may still prevent players from using the full duration of their sunshine. The dps of two or three players is typically greater than Vorago's push back. Thus, it is better to skip debilitate in favor of higher damage abilities to both induce stall from taking damage and dealing more damage overall. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits and creates stall 2nd blue hits and creates stall 3rd blue sent out Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) In the above scenario Vorago pushes back 3 times and you can only take advantage of 2 times he stalls, 2 of which are 3 ticks apart. Now lets look at what Debilitating does. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits 3rd blue sent out 2nd blue hits and creates stall Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) Debilitating prevents the first blue from stalling vorago which means that the third blue gets sent out, allowing his teamsplit attack to happen much earlier. If you have disruption shield, it is best to use it on the second blue and to asphyxiate instead of debilitating. If you push Vorago after he sends out the third blue, you have a chance to take advantage of the stall from the last blue rather than getting pushed while he TeamSplits. Target Cycling at Vorago (Courtesy of #Foxis) Target cycling is extremely useful at Vorago for multiple reasons. It allows you to attack both scopulus on spawn, luring them extremely easily without issue. It can also let you attack Vorago before he becomes immune to a dropdown special attack, like the first waterfall, TeamSplit, or Purple Bomb. On the final phase, you can push forward Vorago before he does a dropdown special attack, which creates push stall, allowing you to do an additional ability. In order to target cycle Vorago on tick properly, you must know 2 important timings. Timing 1: Phase Transition 'Crack' \u2b25 This timing is very easy, as the crack animation is 3 ticks long, and you just need to use movement ability like Surge, Escape, or Bladed Dive on the third tick. Alternatively, you can use Provoke on a training dummy/Vitalis, or learn the timing with any other ability such as anticipate, although the easiest and most beneficial one is to use Escape, as that let's you easily cast Heal Other while staying in range of your partner. \u2b25 The first tick is when the crack first appears, and the third tick is when you use surge. To help, set a metronome to 100 bpm, count to 2 when the crack appears, then use surge. Once you get the timing down in your head it is hard to mess up during the kill. Timing 2: Mobile Cooldown Cooldowns go around 360 degrees on your abilities clockwise, and keeping clocks in mind, we can use this to help make learning the target cycle timing much easier. 9 seconds after your surge/escape with mobile perk, your ability will be at 10 o' clock on 1 tick and 11 o'clock on another tick. On 11 o'clock you need to press target cycling and an instant hitting ability to follow (like dragon breath) (See image below) Dummy Placement (Courtesy of #XTL) Introduction \u2b25 Proper placement of dummies is necessary in kills to ensure that the dummy does not harm the phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An improper dummy can cause difficulties when it comes to properly targetting rago, or with getting enough distance to stall off of the dummy. \u2b25 As a general reference: On a phase transition, one player at random will drop southwest (called the \"default\" drop), and all others will fall to roughly the same location they were in from the previous phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We can use this to our advantage to allow for an easier time dropping dummies on the following phases, and also allow for an easier time 9-tile stalling. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, if you drop the P2 dummy north and both stay near the dummy, one person will drop southwest, and the other will drop north. \u2b25 Typically, if someone has to place their ult on a phase (whether it be Death's Swiftness, Sunshine, or a ZGS spec) then they should not be placing that phase's dummy. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each dummy in this guide has been labeled as either the Bomb Tank's dummy or the Base Tank's dummy, keeping this in mind. Normal Mode \u2b25 Face: Base Tank \u2b25 P1: START OF PHASE - Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (West) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make sure to take the TL drop, and you will spawn in a good spot to drop the dummy \u2b25 P2: END OF PHASE - Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Scopulus: Mid \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The End: NW, SW if no 9 tile stall on P3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 All other weeks: North, SW if no 9 tile stall on P3 \u2b25 P3: START OF PHASE - Base \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Scopulus: Mid \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Prevents re-targetting the dummy post TC tick \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 All other weeks: Drop asap (SW/North) \u2b25 P4: END OF PHASE - Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop in the middle section as the last waterfall spawns, nearest to the waterfall \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Here is an example of a proper dummy: \u2b25 P5: START OF PHASE - Base Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (Out of MD) Hard Mode \u2b25 \u200e \u200eHard mode dummies follow roughly the same idea as normal mode dummies \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, you will want to be making use of SW dummies much more frequently \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is mostly because you will (generally) have more than two people, so even if you needed to 9 tile stall, you cannot guarantee that the person dropping the dummy will be separated from everyone who is 9 tile stalling, so it is better to just have consistent dummy placement. \u2b25 It is not currently standard to use face or P1 dummies, except in the case of Duo HM, in which case it is up to the discretion of the team who places those. \u2b25 P2: END OF PHASE - Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop SW during Bring Him Down \u2b25 P3: START OF PHASE - Base Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (SW) \u2b25 P4: END OF PHASE - Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop SW, end of phase \u2b25 P5: START OF PHASE - Base Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (SW) \u2b25 P6: START OF PHASE - Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (SW) \u2b25 P7: START OF PHASE - Non-Ulting Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (SW) \u2b25 P8: START OF PHASE - Base Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (SW) \u2b25 P9: END OF PHASE - Bomb Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop in the middle section as the last waterfall spawns, nearest to the waterfall Note: This is the same as P4 normal mode \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Here is an example of a proper dummy: \u2b25 P10: START OF PHASE - Base Tank \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop ASAP (Out of MD) Note: This is the same as P5 normal mode \u2b25 P11: END OF P10 - NORTH BOMB TANK \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop as directly before mauling, in MD \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Surge before placing the dummy if necessary \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you are too far back, the dummy will be unreachable at the start of P11 X-Logging Xlogging may be used at the end of the kill to forfeit drop piles to other teammates.

These tips can range from very helpful (to the point where dps strategies rely on them) to just knowing them for the sake of trivia. These are generally organized by phase. Some of this information is already listed on the RS Wiki but for the sake of completion I will reiterate them here. This is not an extensive list of all glitches and misc. tips as I\u2019m sure there are more to be discovered. Unless stated otherwise, all of these apply to both normal mode and hard mode.","title":"Vorago tips and tricks"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#pre-fight","text":"Challenge Timer \u2b25 Vorago\u2019s fight challenge operates on a timer of 20 seconds. If you teleport away after you\u2019ve accepted Vorago\u2019s challenge to fight, and you travel back to the Face area within the 20 seconds, Vorago will still start the encounter and bring everyone into P1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If you teleport away, do not return to the Face area within 20 seconds unless you wish to join the fight. Fake Dropdown \u2b25 There are some methods wherein you can take the dropdown damage but not enter the fight. One method of doing so is to open the \u201cchange username\u201d interface, though you do not need to change your username \u2013 just have the interface open. The dropdown damage will still calculate as if you will join the fight (eg. In a team of five, the dropdown damage will be 10k even though only four people enter the kill). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: This could be used to lessen dropdown damage without having to enter p1 and lobby thereafter, in the event you need to get someone with low HP into the fight. Rest Animation \u2b25 If you are in a rest animation when someone initiates the fight challenge prompt, you will not receive the challenge prompt until you have left the rest animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Don\u2019t accidentally not accept the challenge prompt by resting at Face. Lucky and Dropdown Damage \u2b25 The Lucky perk can proc on the dropdown damage. Defenders and Armor set effects such as the Saradomin Warpriest effect can also proc on the dropdown damage nulling it to 1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Get lucky and take 1 damage instead of 12500. This is unlikely to be useful for regular kills however. Powerburst of Vitality \u2b25 Dropdown is 20 seconds after challenge, so you can time using the powerburst of vitality by using a defensive ability like Preparation. Then right when it has some time before it comes back, you can use the powerburst right then to start the fight with more health than if you just used a phoenix necklace. You can also bring only one dose if you don't need it for the rest of the kill so you can equip your 2h weapons without needing to eat something else.","title":"Pre-Fight"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#tutorial-on-14k-entry-hits","text":"Order to Maximize HP Bonfire with all of your HP-boosting gear; if you have a thermal flask, use it prior to bonfiring Load your preset with your shield equipped Activate Fortitude Eat a rocktail/sailfish soup Lobby You should be 14k+ hp without needing to keep prayer activated, just don't take off any hp boosting items (e.g. shield) or load another preset, else your hp disappears","title":"Tutorial on 14k Entry Hits"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#phase-1","text":"Less Bombs on P1 \u2b25 Once the TL5 reaches the top rock and vokes Vorago, Vorago will throw less auto attacks and often have a longer delay between auto attacks, provided no one else is standing in MD (ie. Base should not voke and stand MD until around 30k hp). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: In trios, this lessens the number of blues and red bombs the Bomb Tank has to take during P1 TL5 Corner and Attack Range \u2b25 Assuming the Base lures Vorago to the North West quadrant so that the TL5 takes bombs as he climbs to the voke spot, the far North West corner of the TL5 path is often too far away from Vorago\u2019s attack range. Thus, if the TL5 spends too long in the corner of the North West section, Vorago will start throwing bombs to the next furthest person which is usually the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: The TL5 should run past the North West corner as fast as possible to avoid sending bombs to the Bomb Tank in trios. How to Lobby P1 \u2b25 If the TL5 is standing on the top platform and vokes Vorago, the rest of the team can run to the South wall and exit combat to lobby. Vorago may throw occasionally throw blue bombs to the people running Southward, though, he will do it so infrequently that you should still be able to lobby in between blue bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Lobby p1 if someone dies and you don\u2019t want to invest more to further the kill. Jump Damage Null \u2b25 Upon the TL5 clicking to jump on Vorago, all incoming damage will be nulled on the tick when the TL5 clicks to jump. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If Vorago is close to HP reset and the TL5 sees someone doing a wild magic that will reset the HP, the TL5 can click to jump and immediately null any incoming damage, preventing an HP reset. TL5 Staying in Combat \u2b25 The jump animation is exactly 17 seconds. As the TL5, it is possible to stay in combat during the jump animation. This requires the TL5 to do an ability on the tick you click to jump. If you do an ability and wait a couple ticks before jump, you will have exited combat and lost adren during the jump animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: This is a way for the TL5 to keep adren during jump and threshold after jump to end p1 faster. Movement After Jump \u2b25 If the Base moves away from MD during the jump animation, Vorago will follow the Base as if Vorago is still in MD. However, Vorago will not visibly move as he is stuck in the jump animation. After the jump animation is over and the TL5 reaches the ground, Vorago\u2019s character will \u201cteleport\u201d to be MD of where-ever the Base has walked to. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: In duos, the Base can escape during the jump animation. If the Bomb/TL5 happens to have a red bomb on them, the red bomb won\u2019t deal 3k damage as the Base is far enough away. Be sure to walk one step north after you\u2019ve escaped to prevent Vorago from moonwalking around the Base. \u2b25 After Vorago has moved to the Base\u2019s MD post-jump, Vorago will not move from that location unless the Base steps under him. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If no one is standing MD, Vorago will continue to throw blue bombs to the Bomb Tank. The Base can step away from Vorago\u2019s MD and devo-cept the Bomb Tank. 1 HP Glitch \u2b25 Vorago will regenerate HP on phase 1 at 1:09 (also 2:09, 3:09, etc.), if Vorago regenerates HP while jumping around before the phase transition, Vorago can have random aggro at the start of p2 meaning the first bleed on p2 will also be to a random person. Vorago can also start throwing blues and potentially reds. The blue and red bombs can follow you through the phase transition damage you upon p2 dropdown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: The Base should target cycle as soon as possible on p2 to ensure that Base has aggro on p2.","title":"Phase 1"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#top-lure","text":"Lure to TL5 Spot in Small Teams (Courtesy of #Tho mas) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmYO-xwpxjo&feature=youtu.be Proper Climbing as TL5 (Courtesy of #Tho mas) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzyfjey6IwQ&feature=youtu.be Stalling Wild Magic as Top Lure (Courtesy of #Keny) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgnThNnO9W8&feature=youtu.be","title":"Top Lure"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#solo-luring-vorago-no-tl5-voke-required","text":"Solo Luring in Hard Mode from the East Wall (Courtesy of #wyld) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu_EvH4Y_Xg Solo Luring in Normal Mode from the West Wall (Courtesy of #Durmoth) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mgdsTZGMuY","title":"Solo Luring Vorago (No TL5 Voke Required)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#crack-healing","text":"Mechanics During a phase transition at Vorago, your character is immune for 1 tick. You can take advantage of this by using the spell Heal Other from the Lunar Spellbook and cast the heal at the same time as a phase transition. Normally, Heal Other will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target player; this results in a large 3-7k typeless \"hit\" on your character that is unavoidable. However, as your character is immune during a phase transition, the Heal Other will not damage your character. Thus, your target player will gain hp at no cost to you. This works on any phase transition at Vorago in both normal mode and hard mode (with the exception of p10 -> p11 at hard mode). How to Perform a Crack Heal \u2b25 Be on the Lunar Spellbook and select the spell Heal Other. \u2b25 Click your target player when the floor shows cracks, right before it collapses. \u2b25 Important Notes \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Your target player must have Accept Aid turned ON in their settings. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you mess up and perform the Heal Other too early/late, the spell will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Heal Group can be used as well, though it requires your target player(s) to be within 1 square of you. Easiest way to achieve this is to ask your partner to follow you, or vice versa. See video for examples: https://youtu.be/3bMTu1YJIbQ","title":"Crack Healing"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#phase-2","text":"Invisible First Bleed \u2b25 The first bleed of P2 does not have a character animation as Vorago is still in his dropdown animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Clear the first bleed by using freedom first, then tag and voke if you are the Base. 1 Tick Bleed Clear \u2b25 It is possible to clear the bleed in 1 tick by first escaping, then bladed diving back onto Vorago within the same tick. You must target Vorago with the bladed dive, targeting the ground for MD will not work and will make Vorago walk towards you. You must avoid standing on the corner of Vorago\u2019s MD as this will also make Vorago walk toward you after you\u2019ve escaped. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: This is another way to keep Vorago in Base spot while clearing bleeds without freedom. Instant Bleed Clear \u2b25 After a bleed is applied, there is a couple ticks delay between when the bleed is applied to when the dismember icon appears on the debuff bar. It is possible to clear a bleed before the dismember bleed icon appears on your debuff bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: You can clear bleeds faster than you think. Voke Splash \u2b25 It is possible to have a voke splash on P2, and (likely) all other phases of the boss too. If a player vokes Vorago and another player is standing within the path of Vorago and the voker, Vorago will aggro onto the person standing in-between instead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Avoid voking Vorago while standing behind another player. See clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/FrigidDeafMooseThisIsSparta Clearing All Bleeds Solo \u2b25 It is possible to clear all five bleeds solo. The order is escape/surge, bladed dive, freedom, escape/surge, bladed dive. Note a mobile perk is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Clear all five bleeds solo in case of dead teammates. 2k Typeless Damage \u2b25 Sometimes, after Bring Him Down, all players in the arena will take a 2k typeless hit immediately after the spam click mechanic. It is unclear what triggers this though it is believe to be an \u201canti-afk\u201d where if players ignore Vorago for too long, Vorago will perform the 2k typeless hit (similar to how you must stay in combat in Yaka). This 2k typeless hit can also be encountered during P1 if the TL5 vokes Vorago and everyone else lobbies, but the TL5 stays in the kill and exits combat. The TL5 will proceed to take 2k typeless hits. It seems the entire team must exit combat for this bleed to occur, though confirmation on this is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Keep above 2k HP after Bring Him Down just in case. Stuck Under Vorago \u2b25 During Bring Him Down, it is possible to get stuck under Vorago after the spam click mechanic. This is usually triggered by standing under Vorago during the Bring Him Down mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Avoid standing under Vorago during Bring Him Down. Bring Him Down \u2013 DPS Check \u2b25 The Bring Him Down DPS check to make Vorago stumble is 50k Hp no matter the team size. This is rather trivial to do in a team size of 3+ but becomes harder in Duos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Do approx. 50k worth of damage during Bring Him Down to get past the mechanic. Bring Him Down \u2013 Staying in Combat \u2b25 Occasionally, it is possible to exit combat and drop adren during the Bring Him Down spam click mechanic. This usually occurs when players have refreshed their combat state before the last Gravity Orb is tagged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: To avoid dropping combat and losing adren during Bring Him Down, do a defensive ability during the spam click mechanic, such as anticipate.","title":"Phase 2"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#centring-vorago-courtesy-of-ry-and-foxis","text":"Knowing how to walk Vorago is useful for moving him on phase 2. First determine his walking direction. Step one tile under Vorago and immediately cast an ability to walk him one tile in his walking direction. Note: If you do not cast an ability he may walk on top of you and around to the other side. Once you determine Vorago's walking direction, it is easiest to manipulate his position from the opposite side, i.e. if Vorago is walking west, stand on the east side of him. In order to move Vorago, he must be following you. During phase 2, Vorago does not follow between the red bomb and start of bleeds. This means if you step out of melee distance expecting Vorago to follow you after the red, he will stand there until bleeds begin. However, he can be walked under which will cause him to move in the direction he is walking. If Vorago is walking south, go west and bladed dive onto the square marked with the blue blubber jellyfish To bring Vorago back to base spot when vorago is lured south during bleeds, step 2 squares north of the square west of L rock and provoke If Vorago is north, step 2 squares south instead.","title":"Centring Vorago (Courtesy of #Ry and #Foxis)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#how-to-tick-shatter-after-bring-him-down-courtesy-of-tho-mas","text":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXqNT7XOOHk&feature=youtu.be","title":"How to Tick Shatter After Bring Him Down (Courtesy of #Tho mas)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#phase-3","text":"Scopulus \u2013 Aggro \u2b25 The Scopulus aggro seem to be random though there are a couple ways to trigger a reaggro. 1) If a player is constantly in motion, the Scopulus tend to aggro them more. 2) A player with an Ice Nihil will tend to draw more aggro, due to the Ice Nihil\u2019s special effect acting on the Scops. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Bring a Smoke Nihil on Scop rotations to avoid drawing aggro. Vitalis \u2013 Base Spot and Vitalis Spawn \u2b25 If Vorago is not moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb will always be sent North, North East, or East. If Vorago is moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb can be send in any direction. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Avoid moving Vorago to have a predictable Vitalis Orb spawn. Vitalis \u2013 Max Vitalis \u2b25 The maximum number of Vitalis that can fill the room in Normal Mode is 15, the max in Hard Mode is 25. In Normal Mode, the number of Vitalis spawning per Orb is 5 on p3 and p4, and 2-4 on p5. In Hard Mode, there are 7 Vitalis on p5 and p9, and between 3 to 5 on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: If you want to block all Vitalis spawns, have the appropriate number of people standing in the spawn Orb. Vitalis \u2013 Death Animation \u2b25 A Vitalis minion is still treated as a physical object while in its death animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: If surrounded by Vitali, be vary of their death animations still counting as a physical object. Same applies to Waterfall on P4, your character will attempt to path around the dying Vitalis which may lead to exiting the waterfall prematurely. See clip: https://youtu.be/-HOB3kLpHgI Teamsplit \u2013 Auto Attacks \u2b25 During the teamsplit mechanic, if you attempt to cast an auto attack on Vorago while outside the max cast distance, your character will run into the max cast distance in an attempt to cast your spell. Often times this results in a player leaving the teamsplit box early and taking 8k damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Do not attempt to auto cast while in teamsplit unless you are certain you are within 7 squares to Vorago. Teamsplit \u2013 Hard Mode \u2b25 The teamsplit boxes in hardmode, although appearing to be only 1x1, are actually 1x2. The square directly east of the 1x1 square is also safe to stand on. The same applies to the teamsplit boxes on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential application: Another safe square to stand on for team split. The End \u2013 Glitch Out of Arms \u2b25 It is possible to glitch out of the arms during the mechanic by standing directly on the South line, or East line, in the respective quadrants. When Vorago\u2019s arm crosses said line, your character is free to move out into the open arena.

Waterfall \u2013 Auto Attacks \u2b25 Initiating an auto attack while standing in waterfall will force your character to run into max cast distance and often outside of the waterfall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Potential applications: Avoid using auto attacks on Vorago while standing in waterfall.

Teamsplit \u2013 Third Waterfall \u2b25 The teamsplit mechanic after the third waterfall is currently glitched. Vorago is still attackable during the teamsplit and if attacked, Vorago will proceed with his rotation and throw three blues, followed by bleeds.

In other words, the Base Tank never receives a Stone Clone. It has been discovered in scenarios where you end in a Solo Phase 4, that Vorago will bug for a few ticks and then proceed with the weekly special, skipping the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks completely. In place of creating the Stone Clone, Vorago bugs for 12 ticks and skips all 7 auto attacks which equates to a total of 56 ticks (33.6s) saved. Overview \u2b25 One player vokes , underwalks Vorago and lures him to whatever wall he's walking towards. \u2b25 All other players quickly position at the opposite side of the arena, so that they leave the visibility range to Vorago. \u2b25 Due to the Base Tank being the only visible player in the arena, Vorago will skip the Stone Clone and its following 7 auto attacks. \u2b25 Vorago will continue his attack order with the weekly special mechanic. Strategy \u2b25 Toggle off running once you enter the Waterfall. \u2b25 Post-Waterfall: Either use Barge as your first ability or Surge within your first ability's GCD Note: On Team Split, use the Mobile perk with gBarge if you plan on breaking the TS. \u2b25 Walk towards Vorago's walking direction (do not run). \u2b25 Toggle on running as Vorago reaches the wall. \u2b25 The moment that Vorago starts moving, all other players should immediately position at the opposite side of Vorago's walking direction (utilise Surge and Bladed Dive ). \u2b25 Once the Stone Clone special mechanic is skipped, move back to the Base Tank Video Example (Courtesy of #XTL) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maGhYnPa92w Important Notes Due to the incredible amount of time gained by a Clone Skip, Barricade will mostly no longer be available for each weekly special mechanic. Due to this it is required to alternate Barricades between the Base and Bomb Tank. Preferably the Bomb Tank barricades the first cycle so that it will be ready in case of a Phase 5 / 10 Barricade.","title":"Stone Clone Skip (Courtesy of #Foxis and #Durmoth)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#breaking-teamsplits-courtesy-of-xtl","text":"\u201cBreaking\u201d a teamsplit involves Vorago continuing his attack rotation during a teamsplit. This is beneficial during phase 4, as it can speed up the phase. However, this is harmful on phases 3 and 5, as it gives you less time to attack the boss. When the teamsplit is broken, Vorago can still use both melee attacks and blue bombs, so keep in mind to eat up if necessary to not die to this. How to Break TS \u2b25 You need to use mutated barge and then apply one of your melee channeled abilities as a bleed directly before the teamsplit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It does not matter which ability you use (flurry, assault, or destroy), however the tick that you apply the bleed on DOES effect how quickly the teamsplit is broken. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Some ticks result in attacks starting slower during the teamsplit, meaning the phases lasts longer, where others result in the attacks starting sooner in teamsplit, meaning the phase doesn\u2019t last as long. \u200e \u200eA consistent way break the teamsplit on a fast tick is to barge immediately after the 6th blue bomb is released after the clone and then bleed destroy exactly one global cooldown later. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Keep in mind to stop attacking before your barge to get the buff. If done correctly, bleeds will come immediately after a phase 4 teamsplit. The first bleed received is somewhat invisible, similar to the first bleed on phase 2, so make sure to watch out for that. In addition, you can sometimes lose aggro, so make sure to voke. Both barge and the bleed following can splash and you will still break the teamsplit.

Melee Dismember on Reflects \u2b25 If a player applies the dismember melee ability on reflects to another player, and the victim player receives the first bleed, the first bleed damage will immediately apply the 4500 damage as if the player was taking a second bleed from Vorago without clearing the first bleed.

Damaged Required to Push Pushing Vorago one tile entails dealing 20k damage to him. As soon as this 20k threshold is hit, the damage counter resets to 0 for the next tile. \u2b25 Example A: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you deal one hit of damage that deals 30k damage to Vorago, 30k damage is added to the damage counter, then the game performs a check to see if that total value is at least 20k. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It finds that 30,000 >= 20,000 holds true, so Vorago pushes a tile and then the counter is reset to 0, effectively losing 10,000 damage. This 10,000 damage is referred to as \u201coverkill\u201d. \u2b25 Example B: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Presume you deal three individual hits of 10,000 damage on the same tick. The first one is added to the damage counter, it checks if 10,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is false, so that hit doesn\u2019t cause it to push. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The next hit is then added to the damage counter, which is now at 20,000 damage. It checks if 20,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is true, so the boss pushes and resets the damage counter to 0. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Finally, the last hit of 10,000 is added to the damage counter, and it performs the same check, but finds that 10,000 >= 20,000 does not hold true. This 10,000 damage stays in the damage counter until the next tick, and this damage is referred to as \u201coverflow\u201d. So the result of these hits is pushing one tile with 10,000 overflow. \u2b25 Example C: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Suppose there is one last hit of 10,000 damage on that tick.

This is most notable on the TeamSplit rotation because the person who suns relies heavily on stall to use their threshes before TeamSplit. While this is not as harmful on other rotations, it may still prevent players from using the full duration of their sunshine. The dps of two or three players is typically greater than Vorago's push back. Thus, it is better to skip debilitate in favor of higher damage abilities to both induce stall from taking damage and dealing more damage overall. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits and creates stall 2nd blue hits and creates stall 3rd blue sent out Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) In the above scenario Vorago pushes back 3 times and you can only take advantage of 2 times he stalls, 2 of which are 3 ticks apart. Now lets look at what Debilitating does. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits 3rd blue sent out 2nd blue hits and creates stall Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) Debilitating prevents the first blue from stalling vorago which means that the third blue gets sent out, allowing his teamsplit attack to happen much earlier. If you have disruption shield, it is best to use it on the second blue and to asphyxiate instead of debilitating. If you push Vorago after he sends out the third blue, you have a chance to take advantage of the stall from the last blue rather than getting pushed while he TeamSplits.","title":"Skipping Debilitate on P5 (Courtesy of #Foxis)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#target-cycling-at-vorago-courtesy-of-foxis","text":"Target cycling is extremely useful at Vorago for multiple reasons. It allows you to attack both scopulus on spawn, luring them extremely easily without issue. It can also let you attack Vorago before he becomes immune to a dropdown special attack, like the first waterfall, TeamSplit, or Purple Bomb. On the final phase, you can push forward Vorago before he does a dropdown special attack, which creates push stall, allowing you to do an additional ability. In order to target cycle Vorago on tick properly, you must know 2 important timings. Timing 1: Phase Transition 'Crack' \u2b25 This timing is very easy, as the crack animation is 3 ticks long, and you just need to use movement ability like Surge, Escape, or Bladed Dive on the third tick. Alternatively, you can use Provoke on a training dummy/Vitalis, or learn the timing with any other ability such as anticipate, although the easiest and most beneficial one is to use Escape, as that let's you easily cast Heal Other while staying in range of your partner. \u2b25 The first tick is when the crack first appears, and the third tick is when you use surge. To help, set a metronome to 100 bpm, count to 2 when the crack appears, then use surge. Once you get the timing down in your head it is hard to mess up during the kill. Timing 2: Mobile Cooldown Cooldowns go around 360 degrees on your abilities clockwise, and keeping clocks in mind, we can use this to help make learning the target cycle timing much easier. 9 seconds after your surge/escape with mobile perk, your ability will be at 10 o' clock on 1 tick and 11 o'clock on another tick.

The Base Tank has several responsibilities, the most important being to apply the Statius's Warhammer special attack in every phase. Additionally you are expected to properly lure Vorago in phase 1 on the eastern wall so that the Climber (referred to as Bomb Tank #2 ) does not receive any Blue Bombs. Required \u2b25 Statius's Warhammer (stored in an Essence of Finality , you will be using at least 10 SWH specs per kill, this can be very costly otherwise) Recommended \u2b25 Heightened Senses (this relic is essential for approaching fast kills with advanced strategies) \u2b25 Stalling Abilities \u2b25 Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Base Tank - Phases 1 & 2 Base Tank - Phase 1 \u2b25 In phase 1 the Base Tank is responsible for luring Vorago in such a way that the top lure cannot receive Blue Bombs. This also causes the Base Tank to receive Blue Bombs on top of melee Swipes, therefore pray flicking between melee and magic is required. Additionally, when the kill timer reaches ~ 30 seconds, you must bring the boss close enough to the final platform of the climb, from where the Climber will voke Vorago into jump spot. \u2b25 The easiest way to position correctly in the start is by standing east of Vorago's spawn location , tagging the boss, moving two tiles to the east , and finally two tiles to the south . By moving two tiles east, Vorago is far enough away from the Climber. Moving two tiles south and then attacking the boss causes you to face north-west, enabling the capability of simply surging north-west when it is time to take the boss closer to the Top Lure. \u2b25 You should surge as the top lure is jumping the last ledge. Continue running to stall Vorago until the Top Lure vokes, then bladed dive south. Provoke Vorago, and wait for the Top Lure to jump. \u2b25 One of the most important aspects of Phase 1 is to pay attention to Vorago's lifepoints - You do not want to deplete it too quickly, as you may accidentally reset the HP. Due to the ease of getting Vorago's HP low enough in time, you will generally have to slow your damage down intentionally before surging. \u2b25 Phase 1 initial positioning Base Tank - Phase 2 The Base Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to basing Normal Mode.

Base Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus The Base Tank has to lure all Scopuli, in addition to hammering the eastern and northern Scopulus. A frequent usage of Vulnerability bombs is very useful for keeping up all Scopuli's stacked and aggressioned towards you, due to vuln bombs dragging Scopulus' aggro. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand directly west of the western Scopulus \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throw a Vulnerability Bomb 3 - 4 seconds before Target Cycle to the eastern Scopulus's spawn location \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throw another bomb as soon as possible (after 3 ticks) directly under you in order to drag the western Scopulus's aggression \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Attack both southern Scopuli with a few abilities > first Scop > second Scop \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As the northern Scopulus comes close enough, target, attack and voke it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run directly south by a few tiles and back north, straight through the Scopuli (this should stack the Scopuli next to / on top of each other) \u2b25 For slower phases you should utilize Devotion and eventually Reflect . Base Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick between melee deflme4 and magic deflm4. The Base Tank commonly takes the south-western corner in melee distance to Vorago. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 5 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Place a Combat Dummy in the start of the phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply SWH as soon as possible \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Activate Limitless for this Berserk \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack shortly after. Base Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb At the beginning of the phase, it is recommended to voke Vorago and walk the boss far enough so that you will not be harmed by a mid mist, and can attack vorago from at least two different of the 9 grid arena sections of the arena. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply SWH as soon as possible \u2b25 On this phase, you will simply be dumping thresholds. On target cycle, release your hammer with a bled assault and continue to thresh. \u2b25 SGB can be perfectly implemented in your pre-Reflect ability damage rotation. \u2b25 If you receive a Green Bomb, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality in order to easily survive it. If the Green Bomb is not on you, it is an optimal strategy to heal the respective Bomb Tank, shortly after they tanked the 10,000 detonation damage. Base Tank - Phase 7 Team Split Similar to Phase 6, you will again only be hammering and thresholding. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply SWH as soon as possible (in Target Cycle) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Reprisal the first Team Split if you target cycled \u2b25 There exist several advanced strategies. Based on your preference, you can either utilize your Adrenaline potion during Phase 7 to have adrenaline to Natty at the end of the phase, or perform a slightly less adrenaline-intensive rotation and save your the Apot for Phase 8. Base Tank - Phase 8 The End \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 7 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 8 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, if available) Drink from your Adrenaline Potion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Place a Combat Dummy in the start of the phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply SWH as soon as possible (on Target Cycle) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, if available) Activate Limitless for this Berserk \u2b25 Fast teams should easily be capable of skipping this phase's Stand Up. \u2b25 If a Stand Up is expectably happening, your team should tag either Red Bombs or Blue Bombs, depending on what you agree on. This aspect is a responsibility of your Bomb Tanks and the Base Tank does not have to worry about it. \u2b25 Drink a sip of the Powerburst of Vitality a few seconds after Stand Up. Alternatively, your bomb tanks may just choose to Barricade and Intercept on Stand Up, due to the relative ease of 0-linking this phase. Base Tank - Tips & Rotations General Tips \u2b25 The Statius's Warhammer special attack enables all following abilities in that tick cast by yourself with 100% hitchance \u2b25 Following advanced ability rotations as provided on the Rago Hub spreadsheet \u2b25 This includes pre-Berserk and pre-Barge rotations, or at a highest skill level utilizing Darkbow auto attacks for optimal adrenaline gain \u2b25 Heightened Senses and Fury of the Small cause a drastic improvement for your Berserk ability rotations, significantly more than Berserker's Fury would \u2b25 Optimizing the usage of Natural Instinct \u2b25 Remove the Mobile perk from your armour so that Surge , Escape , and Bladed Dive generate adrenaline \u2b25 Disruption Shield should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5, during first TS P7 and before P8 Stand Up \u2b25 Greater Fury the Combat Dummy in the start of P7 (since you are not pre-Barging) \u2b25 Take Crackling off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9 Rotations For advanced ability damage rotations, refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Ranged Bomb Tank - Introduction (Courtesy of #Die Alive) Introduction Bomb Tanking at Trio Hard Mode can be performed in several setups. This section focuses Ranged, covering both Bomb Tank's responsibilities: Bomb Tank #1 and Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber). If you are Ranged bomb tanking with a Hybrid on your team, read up on both this and the Hybrid section. This guide section also covers strategies for approaching Double Ranged bomb tanking in Trio Hard Mode. Required \u2b25 Mechanised Chinchompas for Scopulus Phase 4 \u2b25 Up to 4 Combat Dummies Recommended \u2b25 Heightened Senses \u2b25 Ruby, Onyx and Hydrix bakriminel bolts \u2b25 Seren Godbow and Darkbow special attacks each stored in an Essence of Finality \u2b25 Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Ranged Bomb Tank - Phases 1 & 2 Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 1 \u2b25 It is always recommended to have one Bomb Tank ranging in Trio Hard Mode, who will pre-Ultimate start of Phase 1 and deal damage to Vorago, referred to as Bomb Tank #1. The other Bomb Tank is responsible for Climbing and Top Luring, also referred to as Bomb Tank #2. \u2b25 A simple Death's Swiftness standard rotation should be enough to bring Vorago's lifepoints low enough before the Climber jumps. Your Ultimate should be placed right in melee distance, west of Vorago's spawn location. This position should provide you 100% uptime of your Ultimate for most locations that Vorago is lured to. Slow down dealing damage as Vorago reaches 50,000 HP and off early enough to avoid a reset. \u2b25 If the Base Tank receives the second Red Bomb (random), you should cast Heal Other to support the Base Tank's food management. \u2b25 Phase 1 initial positioning Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 2 \u2b25 The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode. \u2b25 Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over Barricading and intercepting the first and third Red Bomb. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one. \u2b25 You should have one person dedicated to shattering the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger). \u2b25 One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy during Bring Him Down. Ranged Bomb Tank - Phases 3 - 8 Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-ECB \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump SGB and thresholds \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, it is highly recommended to utilize Devotion and intercept the other Bomb Tank. Note: If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke Vorago as he jumps for the first time. Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: run! Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs to your Base Tank. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 Devotion Intercept \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Equip Mechanised Chinchompas once the first 2 Scopuli are stacked up \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If available, prioritize using the Darkbow special attack (stored in EoF ) with Chins equipped \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drink from your Adrenaline Potion after your first Darkbow \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Place a Combat Dummy in the end of the phase (decide which of your Bomb Tanks) \u2b25 The BT#1 utilizes Devotion Intercept on the other BT for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the other BT#2 should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out. Note: Do not use Vulnerability Bombs as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4! \u2b25 The Ranged Bomb Tank should always take the southern position during P4, due to lower attack range of Ranged dual wield compared to Magic. Positioning for Bomb Tanks in Phase 4 Scopulus Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick between melee deflme4 and magic deflm4. The Bomb Tanks commonly take the north-western corner and the eastern side in melee distance to Vorago. Note: In the start of the phase, you can position 1 tile out of melee distance, but be ready to step into MD as the Vitalis orb explodes in order to avoid getting blocked or lost Line of Sight from spawned Vitali. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-ECB \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump SGB and thresholds \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, it is best to Devotion or Reflect yourself, although it will mostly be on cooldown if you had a fast Phase 4. Note: If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is recommended to voke the start of Phase 5. Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy as you drop into the phase. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-ECB \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump SGB and thresholds \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phases 3 and 5. This phase is significantly easier due to longer time until Reflect start. \u2b25 If you receive a Green Bomb, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality in order to easily survive it. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, the Bomb Tank who did not receive the Green Bomb should Devotion Intercept the other one. You can also Resonance the first Blue Bomb after Reflect start safely, even with the caused defensive cooldown by a Green Bomb detonation. Note: If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke Vorago at the start of Phase 6. Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy as you drop into the phase. Note: Following a base guideline of abilities in this phase will significantly improve the overall outcome of Phase 7. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tag on Target Cycle with a Snap Shot (quick hitting override required) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you tagged on TC, reprisal right away (optional: sip of your Powerburst of Vitality if ready) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Activate ECB special attack on this phase's Combat Dummy - Do not target the dummy until you activate Reprisal \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, but recommended) Disruption Shield during first the Team Split \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump SGB and thresholds Note: If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke Vorago immediately after the first Team Split. Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End In Phase 8 there exist different strategies (beginner & advanced). \u2b25 Beginner Strategy (Recommended) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump SGB and thresholds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 tags all Blue Bombs and BT#2 Devotion Intercept \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ultimate between third and last quadrant \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Utilize your Adrenaline Potion \u2b25 Beginner Strategy (Safe) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump SGB and thresholds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each Bomb Tank tags 2-3 Red Bombs (avoid increased damage by one BT positioning at the outside, the other surging to the following quadrant asap ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 Ultimate between third and last quadrant \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#2 Barricade Intercept on Stand Up \u2b25 Advanced Strategy Note: This strategy is only recommended to very experienced teams and highly discouraged to use for beginner/intermediate teams. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 7 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 8 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drink from your Adrenaline Potion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tag on Target Cycle with a Snap Shot (quick hitting override required) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Utilize ECB and SGB for first quadrant \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump everything and aim for killing it before the 3rd quadrant Note: If your Death's Swiftness happens to not be placed in the first or second quadrant of Vorago's arms, you should move to the second quadrant, even if you have to leave your ultimate for it. Otherwise you are very likely to die due to suffocation damage. Ranged Bomb Tank - Tips & Rotations General Tips \u2b25 If performing the BT#2 role, transfigure for the 14k entry hit \u2b25 Stalling abilities is sometimes easier by mouse clicking a dummy placed far away from your drop location and far-casting an ability, instead of equipping Excalibur . \u2b25 Disruption Shield should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5, during first TS P7, after tagging bombs P8 \u2b25 Stay MD +1 in the start of P5 until Reflect \u2b25 Take Crackling off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9 \u2b25 Remove the armour piece with Mobile for Escape / Surge / Bladed Dive generating adrenaline \u2b25 Heal Other your Base Tank in P1 if they receive the Red Bomb and end of P2, P3, P4, P6 and P7 \u2b25 Rather skip Natty than nattying too late Rotations For advanced ability damage rotations, refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Magic Bomb Tank - Introduction (Courtesy of #saif0 and #Durmoth) Introduction Bomb Tanking at Trio Hard Mode can be performed in several setups. This section focuses on Magic, covering both Bomb Tank's responsibilities: Bomb Tank #1 and Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber). If you are Magic bomb tanking with a Hybrid on your team, read up on both this and the Hybrid section. Required \u2b25 Up to 4 Combat Dummies Recommended \u2b25 Guthix Staff stored in an Essence of Finality \u2b25 Fury of the Small \u2b25 Seren Godbow \u2b25 Biting 17 \u2b25 Converting to a Ranged Bomb Tank \u2b25 Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Magic Bomb Tank - Phases 1 & 2 Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 1 \u2b25 It is always recommended to have one Bomb Tank ranging in Trio Hard Mode, who will pre-Ultimate start of Phase 1 and deal damage to Vorago. The other Bomb Tank is responsible for Climbing and Top Luring, also referred to as Bomb Tank #2. \u2b25 As Magic Bomb Tank you will most likely be the one climbing in Phase 1. \u2b25 Yet, if you happen to be the one DPSing, a simple Sunshine standard rotation should be enough to bring Vorago's lifepoints low enough before the Climber jumps. Your Ultimate should be placed right in melee distance, west of Vorago's spawn location. This position should provide you 100% uptime of your Ultimate for most locations that Vorago is lured to. Slow down dealing damage as Vorago reaches 50,000 HP and off early enough to avoid a reset. \u2b25 If the Base Tank receives the second Red Bomb (random), you should cast Heal Other to support the Base Tank's food management. \u2b25 Phase 1 initial positioning Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 2 \u2b25 The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode. \u2b25 Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over Barricading and intercepting the first and third Red Bomb.

Magic Bomb Tank - Phases 3 - 8 Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate in the center of Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drink your Adrenaline Potion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (BT #1) Devotion Intercept start of Reflect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Detonate and SGB post-Reflect \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. Executing a stable Metamorphosis ability damage rotation will increase the consistency of 0-linking Phase 3. Note: If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke Vorago as he jumps for the first time. Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: run! Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs to your Base Tank. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (BT #1) Devotion Intercept \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Greater Chain is unlocked, follow it up with a Guthix Staff special attack early in the phase (the Greater Chain buff applies the Guthix Staff affinity stacks and defence drain to all targets) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prioritize AOE damaging abilities and 4taa \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Detonate as soon as all 3 Scopuli are stacked up \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Place a Combat Dummy in the end of the phase (decide which of your Bomb Tanks) \u2b25 The Bomb Tank #1 utilizes Devotion Intercept on the other BT for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the other BT#2 should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out. Note: Do not use Vulnerability Bomb as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4! \u2b25 If you 0-linked Phase 3, your Sunshine will be on cooldown for Scopulus. Simply dump Thresholds and Guthix Staff special attacks. \u2b25 Positioning for Bomb Tanks in Phase 4 Scopulus Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick for melee swipes and Blue Bombs. The Bomb Tanks commonly take the north-western corner and the eastern side in melee distance to Vorago. Note: In the start of the phase, you can position 1 tile out of melee distance, but be ready to step into MD as the Vitalis orb explodes in order to avoid getting blocked or lost Line of Sight from spawned Vitali. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Detonate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump Thresholds \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, it is best to Devotion or Reflect yourself, although it will mostly be on cooldown if you had a fast Phase 4. Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy as you drop into the phase. \u2b25 Straetgy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 5 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate start of Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drink your Adrenaline Potion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Detonate and make use of SGB pre-link \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (BT #1) Devotion Intercept start of Reflect \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phases 3 and 5. This phase is significantly easier due to longer time until Reflect start. If you are going for fast phases, you should skip your Apot in this phase and save it for Phase 8 instead. \u2b25 If you receive a Green Bomb, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality in order to easily survive it. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, the Bomb Tank who did not receive the Green Bomb should Devotion Intercept the other one. You can also Resonance the first Blue Bomb after Reflect start safely, even with the caused defensive cooldown by a Green Bomb detonation. Note: If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke Vorago at the start of Phase 6.

Magic Bomb Tank - Tips & Rotations General Tips \u2b25 Detonate should be pre-charged in most phases, as charging it during Reflects would cause Detonate to be on cooldown for the following phase \u2b25 Use Barrage as primary spell, Blitz might be nulled by Reflect (also P4 Scopulus benefits heavily from Barrage) Rotations For advanced ability damage rotations, refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Hybrid / Melee Bomb Tank - Introduction (Courtesy of #Durmoth) Introduction A general Hybrid setup for Trio HM consists of Melee as primary and either Ranged or Magic as secondary combat style. Magic is recommended due to the naturally increased hitchance on Scopuli. At the current unbalanced state of combat styles, there exists only one method of making Hybrid effective over a double Ranged Bomb Tank setup. Hybridding is only recommended if your goal is improved kill speed, as your team is a lot more likely to lose a kill. \u2b25 It is highly discouraged to take a BoB familiar (Mammoth scrolls with Soups ), due to the lost accuracy from a Nihil familiar already making Ranged a better choice over Hybrid. Therefore a Hybrid setup ends up having a very small amount of food (1 - 3 inventory slots). The selected aura should be Berserker . \u2b25 In phases 1, 2, 4 (Scopulus) and 9 the Hybrid Bomb Tank uses the secondary combat style, Ranged or Magic. \u2b25 Throughout phases 3 - 8 (excluding Scopulus P4) Melee is to be used. A primary portion of these phases will require you (the Hybridder) and the Base Tank to step under Vorago, with the BT#1 voking the boss. \u2b25 Depending on the outcome of your Phase 10, you will either camp Melee for the start of P11 or switch to your secondary combat style immediately during phase transition. \u2b25 As Hybrid Bomb Tank you will be the one climbing in Phase 1. \u2b25 Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phases 1 & 2 Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 1 \u2b25 Generally speaking, a Hybrid Bomb Tank takes over the BT#2 responsibilities. The other Bomb Tank #1 ultimates Phase 1 while the Hybridder climbs. \u2b25 Equip your secondary combat style for the Phase 1 to allow for tagging from the final platform of the Top Lure. Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 2 \u2b25 The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode. \u2b25 Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over Barricading and intercepting the first and third Red Bomb. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one. \u2b25 You should have one person dedicated to shattering the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger). Note: Due to lacking inventory space as a Hybridder, it is recommended to have either the Base Tank or the Bomb Tank #1 take an additional Combat Dummy . One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy during Bring Him Down (preferably the BT#1). Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phases 3 - 8 Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 SGB post-Reflect \u2b25 Your team should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. It is very important for the Bomb Tank #1 to voke Vorago as he jumps away. Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: run! Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs to your Base Tank. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 4 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Prioritize AOE damaging abilities and 4taa \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Detonate as soon as all 3 Scopuli are stacked up \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Utilize Limitless for this Sunshine \u2b25 Place a Combat Dummy in the end of the phase (preferably the BT#1). \u2b25 The Bomb Tank #1 utilizes Devotion Intercept for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the Hybridder should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out. Note: Do not use Vulnerability Bombs as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4! \u2b25 Positioning for Bomb Tanks in Phase 4 Scopulus Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick for melee swipes and Blue Bombs. The Hybridder commonly takes the north-western corner in melee distance to Vorago, with the BT#1 standing on the east side (opposite of L-Rock). \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 5 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drink from your Adrenaline Potion \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack shortly after. \u2b25 It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke Vorago throughout Phase 5 in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under from the opposite side. Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 ZGS spec as you drop into Phase 6 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Implement an SGB spec in your P6 ability rotation pre-Reflect \u2b25 If the Hybridder or the Base Tank receive a Green Bomb, it will be bridged multiple times. A 0-link in this phase is basically guaranteed. \u2b25 It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke Vorago throughout Phase 6 in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under. Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate shortly before Target Cycle (optimally 2 GCDs prior, to allow for a stalled basic released with another basic on TC) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Utilize Limitless for this Berserk \u2b25 It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke Vorago immediately after the first Team Split in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under. Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Dump thresholds (pre-Barge with Mobile to allow for a double Greater Barge rotation) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 SGB spec in the first quadrant \u2b25 If a Stand Up is expected to happen, have the other Bomb Tank #1 tag all Red Bombs and then Barricade Intercept on stand. The Hybridder should pre-Ultimate for Stand Up. Hybrid Bomb Tank - Tips & Rotations General Tips \u2b25 Transfigure for the 14k entry hit \u2b25 DBow autos \u2b25 Disruption Shield should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5 and during first TS P7 \u2b25 Step under for phases 5, 6 and 7 \u2b25 Take Crackling off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9 \u2b25 Do not use the Mobile perk on your armour directly and put it on your Excalibur instead \u2b25 Heal Other end of phases P3, P4, P6 and P7 \u2b25 Rather skip Natty than nattying too late Rotations Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Strategy Summary Weekly Special Mechanics - Phases 9, 10, & 11 Courtesy of #Die Alive, #gasha, and #Durmoth Introduction Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 9 similar to Duo / Trio Normal Mode Phase 4. The person barricading last on P9 should be the person that does not barricade start of P10. Phases 10 and 11 vary the most, relying on the same factors as described in the intro to this Trio Hard Mode guide: Weekly changing special mechanics, several combat style compositions and an individually varying player skill level. This section of the guide will cover 2 basic guidelines of strategies for differently approaching phases 10 and 11: Safe vs Advanced. Safe Strategies A stable order of Ultimates and Barricades for consistently finishing a Trio Hard Mode kill fast with safe strategies. Advanced Strategies Powercreep goes brrrrrr.

Maul Reflect \u2b25 If you miss the optimal opportunity of mauling, continue through Vorago's mechanics and maul at alternative maul timings, as stated in the weekly mechanic channels. If you go through another whole cycle of mechanics, the Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts at the same time as the BT#2 did in the start of P10. \u2b25 One of the Bomb Tanks is usually assigned to placing a Combat Dummy in the end of P10 (shortly before maul). This dummy must be placed in the east and you have to be distanced at least 1 tile to the southern wall. The Base Tank should always maul with a prior cast Shield Dome! Note: Ranged Bomb Tanks should apply BSA throughout phases 10 and 11 to compensate for decreased hitchance once the Base Tank's SWH spec runs out. Phase 11 \u2b25 Base Tank Ultimate whenever it is ready. \u2b25 Bomb Tanks switch Barricade Intercept and Ultimates rotationally. Bomb Tanks Cade Cept / Ultimate Timings Note: Assume BT#2 caded last on Phase 10. \u2b25 Ceilings \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 cade cept either after Team Split or start of Reflect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Team Split throughout P11 \u2b25 Scopulus \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 cade cept either the third auto attack after Purple Bomb release or start of Reflect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second cycle of Purple Bomb / Reflect throughout P11 \u2b25 Vitalis \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 cade cept either the first auto attack after Bleeds or the Vitalis orb explosion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second cycle of Bleeds \u2b25 Green Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 cade cept once the Green Bomb chose its target (if a Bomb Tank is targeted and neither cade cept nor Vitality is available, the Base Tank should cade cept or the other Bomb Tank utilizes Devotion Intercept ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Rotationally repeat cade cepts for every Green Bomb and keep track of cooldowns (Vitality , Barricade , Devotion cevo4) \u2b25 Team Split \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 cade cept after Team Split or start of Reflect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Team Split throughout P11 \u2b25 The End \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#1 cade cept either start of Reflect or the Vitalis orb explosion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Reflect Advanced Phases 10 & 11 Approaching phases 10 and 11 in advanced teams is independent of weekly mechanics. Overview \u2b25 In Phase 10 you always aim for 0-speccing (get to maul before the spec release, e.g. Purple Bomb or Vitalis orb ). This is achieved by pushing consecutively every 3 ticks for 8 tiles from Target Cycle on. Once you reached maul spot, you wait for the spec to release and maul right after. \u2b25 If Phase 10 was executed correctly, Phase 11 should always start with 3 auto attacks (5 if first P10 spec is Green Bomb or Purple Bomb) into the second spec of P11. Rotations For optimal execution of phases 10 and 11 simply refer to the Rago Hub spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing Acknowledgements This guide was written by Saif0 #saif0, XTL #XTL, Die Alive #Die Alive, Gasha #gasha, Sly #Sly, Celly #celly, and Durmoth #Durmoth from the Rago Hub discord community.

This also causes the Base Tank to receive Blue Bombs on top of melee Swipes, therefore pray flicking between melee and magic is required. Additionally, when the kill timer reaches ~ 30 seconds, you must bring the boss close enough to the final platform of the climb, from where the Climber will voke Vorago into jump spot. \u2b25 The easiest way to position correctly in the start is by standing east of Vorago's spawn location , tagging the boss, moving two tiles to the east , and finally two tiles to the south . By moving two tiles east, Vorago is far enough away from the Climber. Moving two tiles south and then attacking the boss causes you to face north-west, enabling the capability of simply surging north-west when it is time to take the boss closer to the Top Lure. \u2b25 You should surge as the top lure is jumping the last ledge. Continue running to stall Vorago until the Top Lure vokes, then bladed dive south. Provoke Vorago, and wait for the Top Lure to jump. \u2b25 One of the most important aspects of Phase 1 is to pay attention to Vorago's lifepoints - You do not want to deplete it too quickly, as you may accidentally reset the HP. Due to the ease of getting Vorago's HP low enough in time, you will generally have to slow your damage down intentionally before surging. \u2b25 Phase 1 initial positioning Base Tank - Phase 2 The Base Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to basing Normal Mode.","title":"Base Tank - Phases 1 &amp; 2 "},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago-trio-hm/#base-tank-phases-3-8","text":"Base Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct in the end of Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drink from your Adrenaline Potion \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Place a Combat Dummy in the start of the phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply SWH as soon as possible \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack shortly after. \u2b25 For slower teams you may also make use of your Limitless ability during Berserk . Base Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus The Base Tank has to lure all Scopuli, in addition to hammering the eastern and northern Scopulus. A frequent usage of Vulnerability bombs is very useful for keeping up all Scopuli's stacked and aggressioned towards you, due to vuln bombs dragging Scopulus' aggro. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand directly west of the western Scopulus \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throw a Vulnerability Bomb 3 - 4 seconds before Target Cycle to the eastern Scopulus's spawn location \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Throw another bomb as soon as possible (after 3 ticks) directly under you in order to drag the western Scopulus's aggression \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Attack both southern Scopuli with a few abilities > first Scop > second Scop \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 As the northern Scopulus comes close enough, target, attack and voke it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run directly south by a few tiles and back north, straight through the Scopuli (this should stack the Scopuli next to / on top of each other) \u2b25 For slower phases you should utilize Devotion and eventually Reflect . Base Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick between melee deflme4 and magic deflm4. The Base Tank commonly takes the south-western corner in melee distance to Vorago. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Pre-Ultimate as you drop into Phase 5 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Place a Combat Dummy in the start of the phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply SWH as soon as possible \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Activate Limitless for this Berserk \u2b25 Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3. \u2b25 If a Reflect occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack shortly after. Base Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb At the beginning of the phase, it is recommended to voke Vorago and walk the boss far enough so that you will not be harmed by a mid mist, and can attack vorago from at least two different of the 9 grid arena sections of the arena. \u2b25 Strategy \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Apply SWH as soon as possible \u2b25 On this phase, you will simply be dumping thresholds. On target cycle, release your hammer with a bled assault and continue to thresh. \u2b25 SGB can be perfectly implemented in your pre-Reflect ability damage rotation. \u2b25 If you receive a Green Bomb, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality in order to easily survive it. If the Green Bomb is not on you, it is an optimal strategy to heal the respective Bomb Tank, shortly after they tanked the 10,000 detonation damage.

He boasts high defense and complex mechanics that challenge even the best players. His unique drops include Tectonic Energies and Seismic equipment. This guide is only an introduction + mechanics guide. For DPS rotations, see #vorago-rotations Drops \u2b25 There are five drops per kill, one for each phase. \u2b25 Drops are allocated to the team in the following manner: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The person with aggro at the end of each phase has a 1/3 chance at any given drop. This is usually the Base Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bomb Tank has a 1/3 chance at any given drop. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The player with the highest DPS in each phase has a 1/3 chance at any given drop. \u2b25 The majority of revenue comes from the Tectonic Energies . \u2b25 Each drop has a 4/5 chance of 2 Tectonic Energies . \u2b25 Each drop has a 1/200 chance at a Seismic weapon , and both weapons have an equal chance. Only one Seismic can drop per kill. \u2b25 Each drop has a 1/5000 chance of an Ancient Summoning Stone , with a threshold of 1000. \u2b25 Most teams split Tectonic Energies and Seismics at the end of the hour. Players should explicitly mention any other splitting methods at the start of the trip. Each total kill is worth 17,876,820, with Tectonic energies accounting for 11,871,520 of that. In trio, advanced players can get up to 6 kph, earning on average 35,753,639 gp/hr each. In 4 man, you can expect 6 kph, earning on average 26,815,230 gp/hr each. Presets - General General Notes \u2b25 In a team of 5+, each player will be dealt 50k/team size upon entry (e.g. in a 5 man team, everyone takes 10k damage) \u2b25 In a team of 4 or smaller, 12.5k HP is required to enter the fight. Each player takes 12.5k upon entry. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can be achieved with alone \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Reaching 12.5k HP before is recommended. Useful when powerbursts are on cooldown, is used to climb quickly, or more HP is required after entry damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bonfire, , and a Rocktail Soup/Sailfish Soup are enough to reach 12.5k HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Other boosts include Nex armor, , Reaper Crew, , and the Ogres' Thermal bathwater . \u2b25 New players must talk to Vorago and go through his dialogue options first before they can enter the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Select \"What are you doing here?\", followed by \"Can I face you?\" \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once players reach the \"So, do we fight?\" dialogue, they are eligible to fight Vorago. \u2b25 The default familiar is for all combat styles. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A Beast of Burden can be used, but is highly discouraged due to Vorago's massive defensive stats. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago is immune to familiar damage. \u2b25 are primarily used only once, during phase 5. They can also be spammed during damage-based phases. Picking A Combat Style All three combat styles are viable at Vorago. \u2b25 Ranged and Melee are the strongest styles. \u2b25 Magic is not far behind, and performs similarly to Ranged if Ranged does not have its expensive best-in-slot gear. \u2b25 Melee can be difficult to use. Its range limitation applies several restrictions. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Not recommended for beginners \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee distance can cause less experienced players to take more damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Unable to Bomb Tank in conventional teams Preset Notes \u2b25 A 1-dose can be used on most weeks for entry damage alone. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Multiple doses are required for Green Bomb, and highly recommended for Ceiling Collapse, Teamsplit, and The End. \u2b25 can be used to build adrenaline between phases for more damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Optional \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Often used with \u2b25 A is eaten after taking entry damage to free up an inventory space for equipping 2H weapons. \u2b25 / / are highly recommended due to Vorago's high defensive parameters. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Other auras are discouraged, though supreme accuracy auras can be used. \u2b25 Putting Turtling 3 over Turtling 4 on your t90 shield is recommended. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The extra tick of Barricade from is irrelevant, and it can cause issues primarily with cooldown on The End P4 if mistimed.

Advanced players can use this time to use . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There are 49 ticks from challenging Vorago to Target Cycle, and 48 ticks from the Accept Challenge message to Target Cycle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop down damage is 33 ticks after challenging Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sample rotation: \u2b25 To time , use a 20s cooldown ability such as after challenging Vorago/accepting challenge. When the cooldown is 3/4 done, use . During The Fight \u2b25 Vorago has two basic auto attacks: Melee Swipes and Blue Bombs \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee swipes target the base tank. They are AoE 1 square around Vorago, and have additional range around the base tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blue bombs are thrown at the furthest player from Vorago, typically the bomb tank. These are homing, deal high magic damage, don't splash, and have a three tile range (7x7) AoE. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago can also do both attacks simultaneously. He will use the animation for a blue bomb. \u2b25 Because all of Vorago's attacks are AoE, all members of the team must be conscious of their positioning at all times to prevent unnecessary and unintended damage. \u2b25 Diagram of Vorago's attack radii: \u2b25 During phases 1-4, Vorago clears , and regenerates stats almost instantly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This includes defense drains, such as \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Affinity debuffs will last their full one minute duration. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Advanced players can spam to maintain uptime. \u2b25 Phases 1 and 2 are the same regardless of the weekly rotation. \u2b25 Vorago's click box spawns in with the boss's animation. As such, Target Cycle can be used to attack Vorago one tick sooner than clicking at the start of every phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can be used to damage Vorago before he uses his first attack, including Teamsplits, Waterfalls, and Purple Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- In cases where Vorago becomes invulnerable after his first attack, a fast-hitting ability must be used. Slow-hitting abilities will be nulled. \u2b25 There is a one tick window between phases during which can be used without taking damage. This can be used to mitigate food usage for the team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This tick is often referred to as the \"crack tick\", as it occurs as the floor is cracking/breaking into the next phase \u2b25 There are 17 ticks from the crack tick to the target cycle tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Target Cycle can be timed by using an ability with a 10s cooldown ability, such as \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Ensure they are not on cooldown when avoiding Vorago's jumps at the end of each phase. \u2b25 Three maul pieces are obtained throughout the fight. The three pieces are combined to create the Maul of Omens. This is used at the end of phase 5 to finish Vorago off. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Maul pieces are dropped during phases 1, 2, and 4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Maul pieces can be left on the floor until the end of phase 4 if inventory space is an issue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not drop the maul piece on a crack tick. This causes the maul piece to disappear entirely, failing the kill. Phase 1 New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Red Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thrown at the furthest player away from Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deals 2k damage in a 2 tile range (5x5) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cancels defensive abilities and puts them on a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage cannot be blocked or reduced with anything other than . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage is increased by 1k for any player standing within a 5 tile radius (11x11) of the target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Comes with a non homing blue bomb that can be dodged by moving. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Non homing blue has a 3 tile radius (7x7) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Can hit any nearbly player, not just the player with the Red Bomb Vorago's Attack Rotation Base Tank \u2b25 There are two ways to lure Vorago on this phase. The beginner method in trio+ teams is to lure Vorago towards the northeast corner so that the TL5 does not receive bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In this lure method, because the Base Tank is expected to move after the TL5 repositions Vorago, and are less effective. Consider using or instead. \u2b25 The advanced method is to lure Vorago near the northwest corner to give the TL5 bombs. This is typical in trios, and expected in duos. Care must be taken not to lure Vorago too far west so that the TL5 can provoke Vorago into the right position. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is a precise / spot which can be used to line Vorago up with the cliff in case of a bad lure. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stand at the west edge of the ultimate if Vorago walks east, and vice versa. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Note that in duos, Vorago can throw Blue Bombs at the Base Tank. This chance is increased if Vorago is east of the jump spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sample Advanced Mage/Range Lure P1: https://clips.twitch.tv/CourageousPiercingStarPhilosoraptor \u2b25 In trio+ teams, the Base Tank should use provoke after the TL5 enters the cliff. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the Bomb Tank is damaging Vorago on the Target Cycle tick, the Base Tank should account for the one tick later entry into the cliff. \u2b25 In duos, the Base Tank can use on the Bomb Tank during the jump animation to help the Bomb Tank survive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bomb Tank's click box will remain at the top of the cliff until the end of the animation. \u2b25 Advanced melee Base Tanks may opt to position Vorago into the proper position for the TL5. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Referred to as \"solo lure\" \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 See #vorago-tips-and-tricks for a detailed explanation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Not used by mage and ranged Base Tanks due to / area limitation Bomb Tank \u2b25 In trio+ teams, confirm with the Base Tank on which lure will be used. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If tanking bombs, make sure to keep HP high after entry damage \u2b25 Position / accordingly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The positions are not precise, and have a large margin for error. \u2b25 In duos, the Bomb Tank is expected to climb while tanking bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The damage taken during climb can be extremely high. This is further exacerbated by the inability to eat during climbing animations. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Try to eat to full HP before starting the climb, and eat accordingly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A fast climb is imperative to mitigating damage. See the TL5 section for the expected climbs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because the Bomb Tank also tanks bombs during the jump animation, the Bomb Tank should eat to high HP before jumping. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Pray to block Blue Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Deflect Prayer can be changed once during the jump animation by clicking on the appropriate Deflect Prayer from the prayer book . The Deflect Prayer will change as soon as the player hits the ground, and will block damage accordingly. \u2b25 In duos, the Bomb Tank can also apply a using the Target Cycle mechanic. This alleviates the Base Tank's rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An additional , or stalled can be used to deal more damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage dealt during climbing animations is nulled. Make sure to delay entry into the cliff by 1 tick to make sure that the damage lands. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Should the damage be nulled, the affinity debuff from will still apply. TL5 \u2b25 Position next to the cliff on the west side of the arena, and spam click to enter. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago does not move until someone enters the cliff. Entering the cliff on time is important to ensuring the Base Tank's lure. \u2b25 Because the TL5 receives a Red Bomb at the start of the fight, should be used during the climb instead of on entry. \u2b25 Climbing quickly is an important, but often overlooked skill. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In trio+ teams, the limiting factor in the phase is often how quickly the TL5 can position Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In duo teams, fast climbs are required to mitigate damage \u2b25 There are three climbs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Slowest, but easiest of the three climbs \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- \u2192 \u2192 Climb Demonstration: https://youtu.be/of6PdOdQBpw \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 using the corner cut method \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- More difficult than the previous climb due to the precision of the corner cut Bladed Dive, but faster \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- \u2192 \u2192 Corner Cut Climb Demonstration: https://youtu.be/tXqfyJwBIyk \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 is used. \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 using the corner cut method \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Most difficult, but fastest climb. Forgoes Powerburst of Vitality, so ample healing is required. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Accel Climb Demonstration: https://youtu.be/fI0yN5-8HtM \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Optional: If Vorago is solo lured, or can be used to move directly from the last gap to the jump spot \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Duo Bomb Tank Climb Demonstration with stalled + : https://youtu.be/2peWQMtrukQ \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Duo Bomb Tank Climb Demonstration with stalled + + : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSwkMG0o5QU General Phase Notes \u2b25 Vorago's HP can be lowered to about 13k, but the phase does not end until the jumper jumps. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 HP will \"reset\" to 80k if it goes under about 13k. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Try to stop attacking at about 25k HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This mechanic also exists on phase 2 before the end of Bring Him Down, and on phase 4 before the final waterfall. \u2b25 The jumper will receive a maul piece in their inventory once they reach the ground. Therefore, a free inventory space is required to jump. \u2b25 Once the jumper jumps, reduce Vorago's HP to 0 to finish the phase. \u2b25 Vorago will jump three times, dealing significant damage any players caught on the landing. Use and to avoid the jumps. \u2b25 Vorago can regenerate 1 HP during the jumps. This happens when the instance timer reaches 1:09. While Vorago can be attacked if he regenerates 1 HP, doing so is heavily discouraged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Some of the unintended consequences include receiving blue bombs during the jumps, and an invisible red bomb that lands at the start of phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first player to tag Vorago at 1 HP will also hold aggro for the first bleed on phase 2 Phase 2 New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Smash \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Commonly referred to as \" Bleeds \". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago smashes the ground five times, applying a strong Destroy Tank bleed onto his current target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bleed hits deal melee damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bleeds can be seen as a icon on the player's debuff bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each tick of bleed damage cancels defensive abilities, and thus cannot be used to block damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tanking a second bleed without clearing a previous bleed results in a 6k typeless hit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bleeds can be cleared with , and distance from Vorago. Distance can be created using , , and . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bleeds are cleared at 7+ tiles away from Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Distance Bleed clears should be done as close to tick perfect as possible, just before taking damage from the first Bleed tick. This maximizes the amount of time the next player has to use . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bleeds can be distance cleared with a simultaneous + to prevent Vorago from moving. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The + is tick perfect, just before taking damage from the first Bleed tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- should be aimed with Vorago as the target, not the ground. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Clearing Bleeds with a diagonal may cause Vorago to move. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago always throws a blue bomb with his third Bleed, but otherwise does not attack during this time. \u2b25 New special attack: Reflect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Also known as \"Link\", and is used interchangeably with Reflect \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago targets one player for 15 ticks. Any damage dealt to Vorago during this time is instead redirected to the targeted player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Abilities do not deal their normal damage, and instead tend to deal more damage than usual. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- e.g. can hit over 20k damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Most bleeds and abilities activated before Reflect that would hit into Reflect are nulled instead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Abilities that would land on the tick the Reflect message appears still deal damage to Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- An ability bled with the special effect will not be nulled, and instead will damage players during reflect. Vorago's Attack Rotation General Phase Notes \u2b25 Phase 2 is time gated. In order to progress the phase, Vorago must absorb at least four Gravity Orbs, which spawn on Reflect. Thus, at least four Reflect special attacks are required. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since this phase is time gated, use as many defensives as necessary to avoid using food at all during this phase. \u2b25 Because this phase is time gated, damage dealt is largely irrelevant. The only notable damage benchmark is to reduce Vorago's HP to under 25k before the final Reflect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DPS ultimates can be skipped. However, they can be used for anyone competing for drops. \u2b25 Stack , and use affinity-increasing abilities to increase hit chance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Up to 6 can be thrown per player. An additional one can be thrown during Bring Him Down. Smash Bleed Notes \u2b25 At the start of the phase, the Base Tank should still hold aggro from phase 1. He should receive the first Bleed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If someone else tagged Vorago at 1 HP from the previous phase, that person will instead receive the first bleed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1 HP aggro can be overridden with Target Cycle. Because a properly-timed Target Cycle ability will attack Vorago before he uses his first Bleed, aggro will shift to the Target Cycling player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base Tank should always Target Cycle this phase to ensure the first bleed if possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A Vulnerability Bomb can be used in place of Target Cycle to allow for more lenient timing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- All other players should avoid Target Cycle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first Bleed of this phase does not have an animation. It occurs as soon as Vorago's feet touch the floor. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago will then randomly aggro any member of the team, including the Base Tank. The Base Tank should use Provoke after Freedom to ensure aggro for the second Bleed. \u2b25 The Base Tank should clear the first two Bleeds using and . \u2b25 The Bomb Tank should use after the second bleed, and clear the third and fourth Bleeds with and . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago always throws a Blue Bomb with the third Bleed. Because the Base Tank just used , this Blue Bomb should always go to the Base Tank. Save for this Blue Bomb, as it is a guaranteed heal. \u2b25 The TL5 should use after the fourth Bleed and clear the fifth Bleed with . \u2b25 In duos, the Bomb Tank takes the fifth bleed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Either the third or fourth bleed should be cleared with an + . \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Otherwise, the Bomb Tank should the third Bleed, the fourth Bleed, and: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Step one tile forward if was used with a magic weapon (8-tile range). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Step two tiles foward if was used with most 2H ranged weapons (9-tile range). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stand still if was used with dual wield ranged weapons (7-tile range). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Optionally, the Base Tank can + clear the fifth Bleed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Useful if the Bomb Tank uses early and tanks Bleeds 2-4 instead \u2b25 Players should stand melee distance when using to avoid moving Vorago from Base Spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players can easily move to melee distance by: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stepping under Vorago, then using a non-channeled ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Equipping a melee weapon and clicking on Vorago \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Barging in Gravity Orb Notes At the start of every Reflect, Vorago will spawn a Gravity Orb. \u2b25 Clicking on a Gravity Orb will cause Vorago to absorb it. \u2b25 A total of 4 Gravity Orbs are required to finish the phase. \u2b25 If a Gravity Orb is not clicked before the next Reflect, a second Gravity Orb will not spawn. Vorago must use an additional Reflect to spawn the required 4 Gravity orbs. This should be avoided. \u2b25 Gravity Orbs have limited range. Vorago must be close enough to each Gravity Orb, or the orb will not be absorbed. \u2b25 There are two positions in the middle of the arena referred to as \"Base Spot\". In these spots, Vorago is close enough to every Gravity Orb spawn such that he does not have to move at all during the phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Base Tank should lure Vorago into Base Spot on the first or second bleed by standing two or three squares south of the L crack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Base Spot three south of the L crack is slightly better, as it allows a north side Base Tank to tag the middle Gravity Orb without moving Vorago. \u2b25 See #vorago-tips-and-tricks for instructions on how to recenter Vorago if he moves from Base Spot. Red Bomb Notes \u2b25 Because Red Bombs cancel defensive abilities and put them on cooldown, the Bomb Tank can take significant damage during this phase. \u2b25 + + is commonly used during Red Bombs to mitigate damage and food usage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Either the Base Tank or the Bomb Tank will use on the first and the third Red Bombs, and the other player will use on the second. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bomb Tank should force the Red Bomb onto someone else when it's the Bomb Tank's turn to use . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- To force a Red Bomb, the Bomb Tank should move closer to Vorago so that someone else is the furthest player from Vorago. Start moving immediately after the third attack during Reflect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- In duos, the Bomb Tank will need to move either melee distance or underneath Vorago to force the Red Bomb onto the Base Tank. Bring Him Down And Transition Into P3 \u2b25 + to the last Gravity Orb. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 must be used during the final Bleed clears to ensure that and are off cooldown for the final Gravity Orb. \u2b25 The phase will progress into Bring Him Down (BHD), during which all players spam click Vorago. \u2b25 Once the bar at the top fills, Vorago will stumble. The team must deal a collective 50k damage to free the next maul piece. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This portion is 20 ticks long. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago is blocking during this time. is guaranteed to land 5 arrows. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Rangers should switch to bolts other than , as procs will deal damage based on Vorago's low HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Reequip before the start of phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago's defense is signficantly reduced during this time, allowing players to reach 100% hit chance quite easily. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage dealt during this time does not affect Vorago's HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 damage does not count towards the 50k damage threshold, and instead will damage Vorago's HP bar instead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is useful if Vorago's HP is still high. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Failing the 50k damage threshold causes Vorago to regenerate a large amount of HP. An additional 2 Gravity Orbs are required to progress the phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A can be dropped in either the southwest corner or north side of the arena during this time to prep for phase 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- is commonly used to aid building adrenaline during phase 3. \u2b25 The second maul piece will appear on the floor after succeeding BHD. \u2b25 to finish the phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A properly-timed can take advantage of BHD's 100% hit chance while still damaging Vorago's HP bar. Sample BHD Rotations \u2b25 Mage (dw) \u2192 (3-hit) \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 (close/fast) \u2b25 Ranged (unequip ) \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (slow/far) \u2b25 Melee \u2192 \u2192 ( ) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 (4t) Note: assuming you are not using , end BHD with before he stands so you get a boosted 188 / on stand Advanced Concept: Natural Instinct Because there is a large amount of time between phases, can be used to build additional adrenaline for phase 3, and later, phase 5. Timing your Natural Instinct \u2b25 There are 40 ticks from Vorago's death to the Target Cycle tick of the next phase. \u2b25 Common notations are: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t0: Target Cycle tick \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t-x: Number of ticks before Target Cycle tick. t-33 would mean 33 ticks before Target Cycle. \u2b25 A common strategy is to use Natural Instinct on a tick that is a multiple of 3, and continuously use abilities. This allows players to build the maximum amount of adrenaline, and time Target Cycle at the same time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The most common ticks are t-33, t-30, and t-27. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t-33 is when Vorago lands from his first jump. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t-33 can also be found by timing a slow-hitting , then using 2 abilities. Make sure is strong enough to finish the phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t-30 can be timed by using an ability using the t-33 visual cue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 t-27 is when Vorago lands from his second jump. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If a different tick is required, a combination of abilities and lost ticks from t-33 can be used to find a certain tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sample Natural Instict Rotation: https://youtu.be/z1Q1e2dY-F8 Phase 3 General Phase Notes \u2b25 Phase 3 introduces the weekly rotation. \u2b25 This phase is purely DPS based. Players should make sure they start this phase with full adrenaline, and all relevant cooldowns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 can be used on a combat dummy from phase 2 to aid building adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An additional can be dropped immediately at the start of the phase to aid adrenaline building and stalling abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Avoid dropping this in the middle of the arena, as it can make Target Cycle unreliable P3: Ceiling Collapse New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Ceiling Collapse \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago smashes the ceiling, causing a large rock to fall on 1/9th of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Any players crushed by the rock will be pushed away and dealt 8000, divided between everyone who was crushed (e.g. two players crushed will be dealt 4000 damage each) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The rock renders the area underneath untraversable \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Rocks can be right-clicked and destroyed at the cost of 4000 HP \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After the rock falls, Vorago will jump to a random 1/9th of the arena, including his current location. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Vorago cannot jump to an area that is already covered by rocks, or will be covered by the imminent rocks Vorago's Attack Rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Falling rocks can be difficult to spot. Shadows enabled and high lighting detail are recommended to better distinguish falling rocks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Using Medium Shadows + no skybox is the recommended minimum to distinguish falling rocks. \u2b25 This phase poses several unique challenges due to the random jump locations. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because the distance to Vorago cannot be guaranteed for any player, this phase is often free-for-all Bomb Tank for all non-melee players. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Be prepared to Deflect Magic at a moment's notice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago can also jump on top of the player with aggro, giving the player little to no time to . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 / should be placed melee distance or under Vorago's spawn position so that players can receive the damage buff regardless of Vorago's position. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Floor markings can be used to find the correct spot. The L crack is melee distance of Vorago on the south side during this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Make sure to move out of melee distance after placing the ultimate. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A rock in the middle of the arena often breaks line-of-sight with Vorago, and interferes heavily with DPS. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Use \u200e \u200e and destroy the rock ASAP. P3: Scopulus New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special enemy: Scopulus \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Two scopuli are spawned at the start of the phase, in the southwest and southeast sections of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each Scopulus has 150k HP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 They are melee enemies, and have typical properties of melee enemies \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Attacks with melee \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Weak to \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Affinities heavily skewed in favor of magic, and heavily against ranged/melee \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 blocks more than the typical 50%/60% damage. Failure to use will result in heavy damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No special attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Immune to familiar damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Does not clear , , or stat drains \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When one Scopulus dies, the other becomes enraged \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Enraged Scopulus heals 15k instantly, and doubles its attack speed Phase Notes \u2b25 Widely regarded as the easiest weekly rotation. \u2b25 Vorago is invulnerable during this phase. The players will be damaging two Scopuli instead. \u2b25 During this phase, Vorago will still throw Blue Bombs. He will not use any other attacks. \u2b25 Because Scopuli deal heavy melee damage, the Base Tank must hold Scopuli aggro to prevent the Bomb Tank from receiving heavy, unprotected damage. \u2b25 Scopuli have unique aggro mechanics. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Unlike most enemies, Scopuli are prone to changing targets. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Scopuli are more likely to target the first player to tag each scopulus. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base Tank must tag both Scopuli ASAP, while the Bomb Tank should avoid attacking until both Scopuli are tagged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Scopuli will frequently change targets the further apart they are. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Scopuli should be stacked on top of each other to prevent this. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Scopuli will frequently change targets if they are not tagged often by the person with aggro. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base Tank should use AoE abilities often to prevent this. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- count as attacks for holding Scopuli aggro. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Ice Nihils in particular are notorious for aggroing Scopuli. Mages should use Smoke Nihils instead. \u2b25 Scopuli can be consistently stacked with the use of Target Cycle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Stand melee distance on the west side of the southwestern Scopulus, and use backward Target Cycle with an AoE ability to tag both Scopuli at once. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The southeastern Scopulus will walk towards the Base Tank and stack directly on top of the southwestern Scopulus. \u2b25 Scopuli can be flanked. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use the Scopuli lure listed above, then walk to the north side of the Scopuli once they are stacked. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clip example of how to lure Scopuli and move into a flanking position - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtBBbOpRx84 P3: Vitalis New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Vitalis Orb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago will throw a Vitalis Orb in one of eight directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If Vorago hasn't moved from his spawn position, the Vitalis Orb can only be thrown in one of three directions (north, northeast, east). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After traveling a short distance, the Vitalis Orb explodes. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The explosion deals 2000 typeless damage, and is affected by damage modifiers. This includes the Berserker auras and defensive abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Vitalis Orb explosion spawns 5 Vitalis. Each player that tanks the typeless damage from the explosion reduces the number of Vitalis spawn by one. \u2b25 New special enemy: Vitalis \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 20k HP each \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deals moderate melee damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blocking \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Also blocks line-of-sight \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Inexplicably forces players to target away from Vitalis, if Vitalis is targeted Vorago's Attack Rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Vitalis is considered the hardest weekly rotation \u2b25 The difficulty of this rotation comes from the Vitali that spawn during this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because they block line-of-sight, attacking Vorago can be difficult, or even impossible at times. \u2b25 In 4 man+ teams, three members should stand melee distance, while the Bomb Tank stands further out to tank Blue Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee distance players will always have line-of-sight to Vorago. They are responsible for the majority of the damage during this phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bomb Tank may end up being completely surrounded by Vitali, stopping all attacks completely. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is okay, as long as the Bomb Tank is still alive and tanking Blue Bombs \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The rest of the team must deal the remaining damage required to finish the phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The other three players should pray \u200e \u200eto block damage from Vorago's melee swipes. \u2b25 In trio and duo teams, everyone should stand melee distance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players besides the Base Tank can stand halberd distance for the first two auto attacks at the start of the phase to help mitigate damage and maximize damage from . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blue Bombs will be sent to one player at random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Prayer flicking is required to stay alive during this phase. Blue Bombs land one tick prior to the next potential melee swipe. These attacks do not overlap. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Prayer flicks are only required if Vorago uses his bomb launching animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players should stand away from each other to prevent Blue Bomb AoE damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 can be used to heal from Blue Bomb damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Risky. Players will receive damage from Vitali, so a tick perfect is required. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Blue Bombs are still random, so the heal is not guaranteed. \u2b25 Finishing the phase ASAP is imperative, as the damage from the Vitali, melee swipes, and blue bombs adds up. \u2b25 Try to finish before Bleeds, as clearing Bleeds with blocking Vitali can be difficult. \u2b25 Duo teams may opt for the safer, albeit slower strategy of standing adjacent with each other. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This allows players to support each other with the use of defensive abilities + . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bleeds can be handled with + . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Bleed tanking player should use on the fourth Bleed, not the first. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Barricading player should after the fourth Bleed, and the fifth. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blue Bombs are no longer random, as they will always deal AoE damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- can be used reliably. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not stand on top of each other. Players that do so will not have line-of-sight with each other, and thus be unable to . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Adrenaline permitting, players can use + during Reflect, and after Bleeds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- delays damage by one tick, but damage calculation occurs at the same time as if was not used. Thus, the prayer flick timing does not change. P3: Green Bomb New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Green Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Most complex special attack, with many different and often detrimental outcomes depending on how it's handled \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Green Bomb will first pick 1/9th of the arena to cover in a green mist. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Mist deals negligible damage every few ticks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Each tick of mist damage drains 10% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Mists do not disappear until the end of the phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After the mist, the Green Bomb will then home in on a player at random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Targeted player receives a notification \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 All Green Bomb hits cannot be blocked, cancel defensive abilities, and puts them on cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If no player is within a 5x5 area of the targeted player, the Green Bomb will deal 10k damage, drain 10% adrenaline, and dissipate \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Additionally, Vorago will immediately skip to his next special attack, regardless of where he is in his current attack rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If a player is within a 5x5 area of the targeted player, the Green Bomb will deal 1k damage, drain 10% adrenaline, and will home in on the nearby player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If multiple players are nearby, one is chosen at random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If the nearby players are also in a 3x3 area of the targeted player, the nearby player will take 1k damage and lose 10% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Green Bomb will dissipate once it deals damage 4 times. There will be a bounce animation after the 4th damage tick, but will not deal damage to the nearby player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If a Green Bomb bounces to a player twice, it will deal ~8k damage if there is another player nearby to recieve the bomb, or ~11k if not. The Green Bomb will then dissipate if there is no other player to receive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the phase ends after a Green Bomb launch but before landing, the Green Bomb will not deal damage. Vorago's Attack Rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Green Bomb is often considered to be the second hardest weekly rotation. \u2b25 The preferred method of dealing with the Green Bomb in any team size is to free-for-all tank the 10k damage without passing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 is required for the Bomb Tank, while heavily recommended for the rest of the team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 While there are normally 5 auto attacks after a Green Bomb, tanking the Green Bomb forces Vorago to skip to his next special attack. This reduces the number of auto attacks to 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Passing the Green Bomb, then tanking the 10k or 8-11k is not recommended. It can cause some unforseen circumstances, such as the second Green Bomb launch at the start of Reflect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If players receive a second Green Bomb, note that the Bomb Tank cannot tank two Green Bombs in a single phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Onus falls upon the Base Tank to protect their Bomb Tank from death. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Players can either use + , or to the Bomb Tank and pass the Green Bomb. \u2b25 The team should spread out, and drop their / such that a single green mist does not cover the entire area. P3: Teamsplit New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Teamsplit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago paints the entire team either red or blue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Teamsplit cancels defensives and puts them on a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Two 2x2 squares will spawn in the arena, red and blue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players can run to the color square that corresponds with their color. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 All players not standing in the correct square when Vorago explodes will take 8000 typeless damage that cannot be blocked by defensive abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago is invulnerable before he explodes. Vorago's Attack Rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Teamsplit is a simple and slow-paced mechanic, which makes it easy for beginners to grasp. \u2b25 The difficulty of this weekly rotation lies in trying to deal damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because Teamsplit and Reflect both prevent damage to Vorago, players will need to maximize their damage in what little time Vorago is vulnerable. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because Teamsplit spawn locations are random, players will need to tank the damage from at least one Teamsplit to maximize time in / . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- + \u200e \u200ecan be used to increase survivability and deal more damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bomb Tanks that choose to tank the second Teamsplit should be aware that a long phase can be difficult to survive. Be prepared to eat upon the Red Bomb release. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Beginners may find it easier to forgo / \u200e \u200eentirely and only use thresholds + special attacks instead \u2b25 Abilites bled with the effect can hit into Vorago's invulnerability during Teamsplits. While they don't deal damage, they force Vorago to continue attacking during Teamsplit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is often called a \"Broken Teamsplit\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Very detrimental on this phase, as it severely reduces the amount of time the team has to DPS. It can also kill unsuspecting players. \u2b25 The duration between the first Teamsplit explosion and Reflect is one tick shorter if players used an ability on the Target Cycle tick. \u2b25 The Base Tank should move to melee distance and to reduce the damage the Bomb Tank receives during this phase. This should be done during Reflect, or rotation permitting, the entire phase. P3: The End New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: The End \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago slams his arms down, sectioning off a quarter of the arena \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Anyone caught outside the arms will take a typeless bleed that can only be blocked by . This bleed deals damage every other tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It ramps up quickly if players don't move back into the arms. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago spawns 1 Purple Bomb per player, and 5 Blue Bombs + 3 Red Bombs regardless of team size. One type of bomb spawns in each of the other three quadrants. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Red and Blue Bombs are always second and third, though the order in which they appear is random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Purple Bombs are always last. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago will rotate his arms anticlockwise until he reaches the Purple Bomb quadrant. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Anyone caught outside the arms who wish to reenter must be in a quadrant before the arms reach that area. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bombs can be individually launched while Vorago's arms are in the appropriate quadrant. This is often called \"tagging\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the first 21 ticks, Vorago takes full damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the Blue Bomb quadrant, Vorago takes 1/2 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the Red Bomb quadrant, Vorago takes 1/3 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the Purple Bomb quadrant, Vorago takes 1/4 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once Vorago reaches the Purple Bomb quadrant, Vorago will stand up and launch any bombs that weren't tagged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bombs are evenly distributed among the team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Each player will receive ceiling(number of bombs/team size) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- In duos, leaving the 5 Blue Bombs and 3 Red Bombs means each player takes 3 Blue Bombs and 2 Red Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Before standing, Vorago is a blocking entity. will always land five arrows. \u2b25 New special attack: Purple Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Occurs only during The End special attack \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deals 2k damage, and is unaffected by defensive abilities except \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deals AoE damage to any players in a 5x5 radius, and drains 5% adrenaline from any secondary targets \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Transforms the player, cancelling and preventing the use of \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Does not affect defensive abilities, and does not increase in damage Vorago's attack rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Often called \"Purple Bomb\" \u2b25 This rotation, like Teamsplit, is easy to learn, but difficult to master. There is a limited amount of time to DPS. \u2b25 There are several ways to handle the bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Safest Method: + Blue Bombs. One player tags 2 Red Bombs, while the other player tags 1 Red Bomb. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This ensures players do not receive a heavy amount of burst damage when Vorago stands. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- One player must tag the Blue Bombs, while the other player must + on the entire team. The tagging player will have his defensive abilities cancelled and put on a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Slowest method, as it requires players to use adrenaline on , and sustain the adrenaline loss from the Red Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base should move melee distance and on stand to reduce the damage taken by the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Middle Ground Method: + . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Like the previous method, one player tags Blue Bombs while the other player uses + on the entire team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Red Bombs are left alone to be tanked upon stand. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base should move melee distance and on stand to reduce the damage taken by the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Fastest, Riskiest Method: Tag nothing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Maximizes adrenaline and DPS \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Players will receive heavy burst damage on stand. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- should be used to help tank some damage on stand, if the phase reaches that point. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Bomb Tank should use on stand to prevent the Base Tank from tanking melee swipes and Blue Bombs at the same time. \u2b25 Bomb tagging roles fall upon the Base Tank and Bomb Tank, unless otherwise specified. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Either player can do either tagging or + . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Confirm with the team which method is to be used. \u2b25 While Vorago is normally invulnerable during the the arm slam animation, he will continue to take damage from any abilities bled using . \u2b25 Players can escape from the arms without taking the bleed damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Often called \"glitching out\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Vorago is focused on the southwest or southeast quadrant, players can stand on where the arms would close into the next quadrant. The arm will be on top of the player. From there, players can freely move around the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Only works on the south and east arms. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Only recommended if using the no tag method, or the player is not resposible for handling the bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Glitching out prevents players from tagging bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Can be used to spread out DPS ultimates, preventing bombs from dealing AoE damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Diagram on glitching out","title":"Vorago"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago/#vorago","text":"","title":"Vorago"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago/#vorago-courtesy-of-namov","text":"Introduction Vorago is a high level group boss.

Advanced players can use this time to use . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There are 49 ticks from challenging Vorago to Target Cycle, and 48 ticks from the Accept Challenge message to Target Cycle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Drop down damage is 33 ticks after challenging Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sample rotation: \u2b25 To time , use a 20s cooldown ability such as after challenging Vorago/accepting challenge. When the cooldown is 3/4 done, use . During The Fight \u2b25 Vorago has two basic auto attacks: Melee Swipes and Blue Bombs \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Melee swipes target the base tank. They are AoE 1 square around Vorago, and have additional range around the base tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blue bombs are thrown at the furthest player from Vorago, typically the bomb tank. These are homing, deal high magic damage, don't splash, and have a three tile range (7x7) AoE. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago can also do both attacks simultaneously. He will use the animation for a blue bomb. \u2b25 Because all of Vorago's attacks are AoE, all members of the team must be conscious of their positioning at all times to prevent unnecessary and unintended damage. \u2b25 Diagram of Vorago's attack radii: \u2b25 During phases 1-4, Vorago clears , and regenerates stats almost instantly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This includes defense drains, such as \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Affinity debuffs will last their full one minute duration. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Advanced players can spam to maintain uptime. \u2b25 Phases 1 and 2 are the same regardless of the weekly rotation. \u2b25 Vorago's click box spawns in with the boss's animation. As such, Target Cycle can be used to attack Vorago one tick sooner than clicking at the start of every phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This can be used to damage Vorago before he uses his first attack, including Teamsplits, Waterfalls, and Purple Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- In cases where Vorago becomes invulnerable after his first attack, a fast-hitting ability must be used. Slow-hitting abilities will be nulled. \u2b25 There is a one tick window between phases during which can be used without taking damage. This can be used to mitigate food usage for the team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This tick is often referred to as the \"crack tick\", as it occurs as the floor is cracking/breaking into the next phase \u2b25 There are 17 ticks from the crack tick to the target cycle tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Target Cycle can be timed by using an ability with a 10s cooldown ability, such as \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Ensure they are not on cooldown when avoiding Vorago's jumps at the end of each phase. \u2b25 Three maul pieces are obtained throughout the fight. The three pieces are combined to create the Maul of Omens. This is used at the end of phase 5 to finish Vorago off. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Maul pieces are dropped during phases 1, 2, and 4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Maul pieces can be left on the floor until the end of phase 4 if inventory space is an issue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Do not drop the maul piece on a crack tick. This causes the maul piece to disappear entirely, failing the kill.","title":"General Fight Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago/#phase-1","text":"New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Red Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thrown at the furthest player away from Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deals 2k damage in a 2 tile range (5x5) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Cancels defensive abilities and puts them on a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage cannot be blocked or reduced with anything other than . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage is increased by 1k for any player standing within a 5 tile radius (11x11) of the target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Comes with a non homing blue bomb that can be dodged by moving. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Non homing blue has a 3 tile radius (7x7) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Can hit any nearbly player, not just the player with the Red Bomb Vorago's Attack Rotation Base Tank \u2b25 There are two ways to lure Vorago on this phase. The beginner method in trio+ teams is to lure Vorago towards the northeast corner so that the TL5 does not receive bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In this lure method, because the Base Tank is expected to move after the TL5 repositions Vorago, and are less effective. Consider using or instead. \u2b25 The advanced method is to lure Vorago near the northwest corner to give the TL5 bombs. This is typical in trios, and expected in duos. Care must be taken not to lure Vorago too far west so that the TL5 can provoke Vorago into the right position. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There is a precise / spot which can be used to line Vorago up with the cliff in case of a bad lure. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Stand at the west edge of the ultimate if Vorago walks east, and vice versa. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Note that in duos, Vorago can throw Blue Bombs at the Base Tank. This chance is increased if Vorago is east of the jump spot. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sample Advanced Mage/Range Lure P1: https://clips.twitch.tv/CourageousPiercingStarPhilosoraptor \u2b25 In trio+ teams, the Base Tank should use provoke after the TL5 enters the cliff. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the Bomb Tank is damaging Vorago on the Target Cycle tick, the Base Tank should account for the one tick later entry into the cliff. \u2b25 In duos, the Base Tank can use on the Bomb Tank during the jump animation to help the Bomb Tank survive. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bomb Tank's click box will remain at the top of the cliff until the end of the animation. \u2b25 Advanced melee Base Tanks may opt to position Vorago into the proper position for the TL5. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Referred to as \"solo lure\" \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 See #vorago-tips-and-tricks for a detailed explanation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Not used by mage and ranged Base Tanks due to / area limitation Bomb Tank \u2b25 In trio+ teams, confirm with the Base Tank on which lure will be used. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If tanking bombs, make sure to keep HP high after entry damage \u2b25 Position / accordingly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The positions are not precise, and have a large margin for error. \u2b25 In duos, the Bomb Tank is expected to climb while tanking bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The damage taken during climb can be extremely high. This is further exacerbated by the inability to eat during climbing animations. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Try to eat to full HP before starting the climb, and eat accordingly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A fast climb is imperative to mitigating damage. See the TL5 section for the expected climbs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because the Bomb Tank also tanks bombs during the jump animation, the Bomb Tank should eat to high HP before jumping. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Pray to block Blue Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Deflect Prayer can be changed once during the jump animation by clicking on the appropriate Deflect Prayer from the prayer book . The Deflect Prayer will change as soon as the player hits the ground, and will block damage accordingly. \u2b25 In duos, the Bomb Tank can also apply a using the Target Cycle mechanic. This alleviates the Base Tank's rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An additional , or stalled can be used to deal more damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage dealt during climbing animations is nulled. Make sure to delay entry into the cliff by 1 tick to make sure that the damage lands. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Should the damage be nulled, the affinity debuff from will still apply. TL5 \u2b25 Position next to the cliff on the west side of the arena, and spam click to enter. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago does not move until someone enters the cliff. Entering the cliff on time is important to ensuring the Base Tank's lure. \u2b25 Because the TL5 receives a Red Bomb at the start of the fight, should be used during the climb instead of on entry. \u2b25 Climbing quickly is an important, but often overlooked skill. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In trio+ teams, the limiting factor in the phase is often how quickly the TL5 can position Vorago. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In duo teams, fast climbs are required to mitigate damage \u2b25 There are three climbs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Slowest, but easiest of the three climbs \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- \u2192 \u2192 Climb Demonstration: https://youtu.be/of6PdOdQBpw \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 using the corner cut method \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- More difficult than the previous climb due to the precision of the corner cut Bladed Dive, but faster \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- \u2192 \u2192 Corner Cut Climb Demonstration: https://youtu.be/tXqfyJwBIyk \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 is used. \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 using the corner cut method \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Most difficult, but fastest climb.

Therefore, a free inventory space is required to jump. \u2b25 Once the jumper jumps, reduce Vorago's HP to 0 to finish the phase. \u2b25 Vorago will jump three times, dealing significant damage any players caught on the landing. Use and to avoid the jumps. \u2b25 Vorago can regenerate 1 HP during the jumps. This happens when the instance timer reaches 1:09. While Vorago can be attacked if he regenerates 1 HP, doing so is heavily discouraged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Some of the unintended consequences include receiving blue bombs during the jumps, and an invisible red bomb that lands at the start of phase 2. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first player to tag Vorago at 1 HP will also hold aggro for the first bleed on phase 2","title":"Phase 1"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago/#phase-2","text":"New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Smash \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Commonly referred to as \" Bleeds \". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago smashes the ground five times, applying a strong Destroy Tank bleed onto his current target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bleed hits deal melee damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bleeds can be seen as a icon on the player's debuff bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Each tick of bleed damage cancels defensive abilities, and thus cannot be used to block damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tanking a second bleed without clearing a previous bleed results in a 6k typeless hit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bleeds can be cleared with , and distance from Vorago.

Vorago's Attack Rotation General Phase Notes \u2b25 Phase 2 is time gated. In order to progress the phase, Vorago must absorb at least four Gravity Orbs, which spawn on Reflect. Thus, at least four Reflect special attacks are required. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since this phase is time gated, use as many defensives as necessary to avoid using food at all during this phase. \u2b25 Because this phase is time gated, damage dealt is largely irrelevant. The only notable damage benchmark is to reduce Vorago's HP to under 25k before the final Reflect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DPS ultimates can be skipped. However, they can be used for anyone competing for drops. \u2b25 Stack , and use affinity-increasing abilities to increase hit chance. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Up to 6 can be thrown per player. An additional one can be thrown during Bring Him Down. Smash Bleed Notes \u2b25 At the start of the phase, the Base Tank should still hold aggro from phase 1. He should receive the first Bleed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If someone else tagged Vorago at 1 HP from the previous phase, that person will instead receive the first bleed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1 HP aggro can be overridden with Target Cycle. Because a properly-timed Target Cycle ability will attack Vorago before he uses his first Bleed, aggro will shift to the Target Cycling player. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base Tank should always Target Cycle this phase to ensure the first bleed if possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A Vulnerability Bomb can be used in place of Target Cycle to allow for more lenient timing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- All other players should avoid Target Cycle. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first Bleed of this phase does not have an animation. It occurs as soon as Vorago's feet touch the floor. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago will then randomly aggro any member of the team, including the Base Tank. The Base Tank should use Provoke after Freedom to ensure aggro for the second Bleed. \u2b25 The Base Tank should clear the first two Bleeds using and . \u2b25 The Bomb Tank should use after the second bleed, and clear the third and fourth Bleeds with and . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago always throws a Blue Bomb with the third Bleed.

Vorago must use an additional Reflect to spawn the required 4 Gravity orbs. This should be avoided. \u2b25 Gravity Orbs have limited range. Vorago must be close enough to each Gravity Orb, or the orb will not be absorbed. \u2b25 There are two positions in the middle of the arena referred to as \"Base Spot\". In these spots, Vorago is close enough to every Gravity Orb spawn such that he does not have to move at all during the phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Base Tank should lure Vorago into Base Spot on the first or second bleed by standing two or three squares south of the L crack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Base Spot three south of the L crack is slightly better, as it allows a north side Base Tank to tag the middle Gravity Orb without moving Vorago. \u2b25 See #vorago-tips-and-tricks for instructions on how to recenter Vorago if he moves from Base Spot. Red Bomb Notes \u2b25 Because Red Bombs cancel defensive abilities and put them on cooldown, the Bomb Tank can take significant damage during this phase. \u2b25 + + is commonly used during Red Bombs to mitigate damage and food usage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Either the Base Tank or the Bomb Tank will use on the first and the third Red Bombs, and the other player will use on the second. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Bomb Tank should force the Red Bomb onto someone else when it's the Bomb Tank's turn to use . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- To force a Red Bomb, the Bomb Tank should move closer to Vorago so that someone else is the furthest player from Vorago.

Vorago's Attack Rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Green Bomb is often considered to be the second hardest weekly rotation. \u2b25 The preferred method of dealing with the Green Bomb in any team size is to free-for-all tank the 10k damage without passing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 is required for the Bomb Tank, while heavily recommended for the rest of the team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 While there are normally 5 auto attacks after a Green Bomb, tanking the Green Bomb forces Vorago to skip to his next special attack. This reduces the number of auto attacks to 3. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Passing the Green Bomb, then tanking the 10k or 8-11k is not recommended. It can cause some unforseen circumstances, such as the second Green Bomb launch at the start of Reflect. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If players receive a second Green Bomb, note that the Bomb Tank cannot tank two Green Bombs in a single phase. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Onus falls upon the Base Tank to protect their Bomb Tank from death. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Players can either use + , or to the Bomb Tank and pass the Green Bomb. \u2b25 The team should spread out, and drop their / such that a single green mist does not cover the entire area.","title":"P3: Green Bomb"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago/#p3-teamsplit","text":"New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: Teamsplit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago paints the entire team either red or blue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Teamsplit cancels defensives and puts them on a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Two 2x2 squares will spawn in the arena, red and blue. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players can run to the color square that corresponds with their color. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 All players not standing in the correct square when Vorago explodes will take 8000 typeless damage that cannot be blocked by defensive abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago is invulnerable before he explodes. Vorago's Attack Rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Teamsplit is a simple and slow-paced mechanic, which makes it easy for beginners to grasp. \u2b25 The difficulty of this weekly rotation lies in trying to deal damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because Teamsplit and Reflect both prevent damage to Vorago, players will need to maximize their damage in what little time Vorago is vulnerable. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Because Teamsplit spawn locations are random, players will need to tank the damage from at least one Teamsplit to maximize time in / . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- + \u200e \u200ecan be used to increase survivability and deal more damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bomb Tanks that choose to tank the second Teamsplit should be aware that a long phase can be difficult to survive. Be prepared to eat upon the Red Bomb release. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Beginners may find it easier to forgo / \u200e \u200eentirely and only use thresholds + special attacks instead \u2b25 Abilites bled with the effect can hit into Vorago's invulnerability during Teamsplits. While they don't deal damage, they force Vorago to continue attacking during Teamsplit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is often called a \"Broken Teamsplit\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Very detrimental on this phase, as it severely reduces the amount of time the team has to DPS. It can also kill unsuspecting players. \u2b25 The duration between the first Teamsplit explosion and Reflect is one tick shorter if players used an ability on the Target Cycle tick. \u2b25 The Base Tank should move to melee distance and to reduce the damage the Bomb Tank receives during this phase. This should be done during Reflect, or rotation permitting, the entire phase.","title":"P3: Teamsplit"},{"location":"pvme-guides/vorago/vorago/#p3-the-end","text":"New Special Mechanics \u2b25 New special attack: The End \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago slams his arms down, sectioning off a quarter of the arena \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Anyone caught outside the arms will take a typeless bleed that can only be blocked by . This bleed deals damage every other tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It ramps up quickly if players don't move back into the arms. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago spawns 1 Purple Bomb per player, and 5 Blue Bombs + 3 Red Bombs regardless of team size. One type of bomb spawns in each of the other three quadrants. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Red and Blue Bombs are always second and third, though the order in which they appear is random. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Purple Bombs are always last. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago will rotate his arms anticlockwise until he reaches the Purple Bomb quadrant. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Anyone caught outside the arms who wish to reenter must be in a quadrant before the arms reach that area. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bombs can be individually launched while Vorago's arms are in the appropriate quadrant. This is often called \"tagging\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 During the first 21 ticks, Vorago takes full damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the Blue Bomb quadrant, Vorago takes 1/2 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the Red Bomb quadrant, Vorago takes 1/3 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the Purple Bomb quadrant, Vorago takes 1/4 damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Once Vorago reaches the Purple Bomb quadrant, Vorago will stand up and launch any bombs that weren't tagged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Bombs are evenly distributed among the team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Each player will receive ceiling(number of bombs/team size) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- In duos, leaving the 5 Blue Bombs and 3 Red Bombs means each player takes 3 Blue Bombs and 2 Red Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Before standing, Vorago is a blocking entity. will always land five arrows. \u2b25 New special attack: Purple Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Occurs only during The End special attack \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deals 2k damage, and is unaffected by defensive abilities except \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deals AoE damage to any players in a 5x5 radius, and drains 5% adrenaline from any secondary targets \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Transforms the player, cancelling and preventing the use of \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Does not affect defensive abilities, and does not increase in damage Vorago's attack rotation Phase Notes \u2b25 Often called \"Purple Bomb\" \u2b25 This rotation, like Teamsplit, is easy to learn, but difficult to master. There is a limited amount of time to DPS. \u2b25 There are several ways to handle the bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Safest Method: + Blue Bombs. One player tags 2 Red Bombs, while the other player tags 1 Red Bomb. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This ensures players do not receive a heavy amount of burst damage when Vorago stands. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- One player must tag the Blue Bombs, while the other player must + on the entire team. The tagging player will have his defensive abilities cancelled and put on a short cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Slowest method, as it requires players to use adrenaline on , and sustain the adrenaline loss from the Red Bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base should move melee distance and on stand to reduce the damage taken by the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Middle Ground Method: + . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Like the previous method, one player tags Blue Bombs while the other player uses + on the entire team. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Red Bombs are left alone to be tanked upon stand. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Base should move melee distance and on stand to reduce the damage taken by the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Fastest, Riskiest Method: Tag nothing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Maximizes adrenaline and DPS \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Players will receive heavy burst damage on stand. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- should be used to help tank some damage on stand, if the phase reaches that point. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The Bomb Tank should use on stand to prevent the Base Tank from tanking melee swipes and Blue Bombs at the same time. \u2b25 Bomb tagging roles fall upon the Base Tank and Bomb Tank, unless otherwise specified. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Either player can do either tagging or + . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Confirm with the team which method is to be used. \u2b25 While Vorago is normally invulnerable during the the arm slam animation, he will continue to take damage from any abilities bled using . \u2b25 Players can escape from the arms without taking the bleed damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Often called \"glitching out\". \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If Vorago is focused on the southwest or southeast quadrant, players can stand on where the arms would close into the next quadrant. The arm will be on top of the player. From there, players can freely move around the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Only works on the south and east arms. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Only recommended if using the no tag method, or the player is not resposible for handling the bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Glitching out prevents players from tagging bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Can be used to spread out DPS ultimates, preventing bombs from dealing AoE damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Diagram on glitching out","title":"P3: The End"}]}
