## Introduction


This guide is oriented towards first time mobile users and those looking to set up themselves better to succeed. Once you are set up properly and used to using the mobile interface, all other guides can be roughly followed.


## Getting Started





To enter combat mode you simply press the shield and sword icon in the bottom left corner.

**^^Main Action Bar^^**

⬥ This should contain any switches, defensives, food, potions and prayers you will be needing during the fight.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Omit anything from the bar that is not time sensitive that may be used within a large window.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Overload, excalibur, elven ritual shard, prayer potions, etc.

⬥ To change your main action bar, press the number on the far left to open a menu to change the Main Action Bar.

⬥ More advanced bosses and rotations may involve using additional bars, this will be covered later.

⬥ Try to keep switches, prayers and food on the left side of this bar so you may open ability books to manually use abilities.

⬥ These are set up in this way so you can open your ability books and manually cast abilities while having access to your prayers, weapons and food.


**^^Revolution Action Bar^^**

⬥ This is a normal revolution bar, you may change the number of slots it uses in combat settings.

⬥ For help making optimal revolution bars:

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• [#pvm-spreadsheets](../miscellaneous-information/pvm-spreadsheets.md)

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Contains a variety of information on ability damage

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• **Revolution Damage Calculator** - <http://rs-revolution.herokuapp.com/bar/>

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Helps compare damage on different ability bars

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• **RuneScape Wiki** - <https://runescape.wiki/w/Revolution/Bars>

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- In depth sample revolution bars

*Note: You may also choose to use `!revo` or `!revo++` in <a href="" class="inactiveLink">#bot-commands</a> for more examples.*


**^^Target Information^^**

⬥ Shows you the information on your current target.

⬥ You may tap this button to target cycle to a new target as well.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• For more information on target cycling see [#mechanics](../miscellaneous-information/mechanics.md).


**^^Player Status^^**

⬥ Displays your current buffs, debuffs, HP, adrenaline, prayer points and summoning points.


**^^Combat Settings^^**

⬥ Revolution Action Bar remains the same and Main action bar has been swapped

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• This action bar may be for a specialized dps rotation, to deal with mechanics, etc.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• This normally will include abilities which yould would otherwise be unable to cast back to back from ability books.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- An example of this would be <img title="ingen" class="d-emoji" alt="ingen" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/641339234111848463.png?v=1"> + <img title="ent" class="d-emoji" alt="ent" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/567727987274022924.png?v=1"> + ability

**^^Afk Content^^**

Plenty of content is able to be done completely afk, below is a list of some examples of guides of afk content. The mobile client has a slightly larger area loot range and is prefered for afking spread out targets, this may be further extended with the Lorehound pet.
