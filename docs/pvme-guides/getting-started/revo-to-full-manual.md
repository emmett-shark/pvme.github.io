# Revo to full manual
## Introduction


⬥ The Revolution combat mode allows the game to automatically activate abilities on your ability bar in a sequential order. There are three modes to revolution: only basics (revo), basics and thresholds (revo+), or basics, thresholds and ultimates (revo++).

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• For a player just getting into PvM, it is perfectly fine to use revolution.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• There are helpful guides and ability bar set ups on the official RS Wiki that make Revolution viable in combat.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• For most combat situations and scenarios, Revolution is OK enough.



⬥ Full manual is a combat mode where the game does not activate any abilities for you. Every ability you want to use in combat will require an input from the player.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• With no inputs from the player, full manual will only use auto attacks.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Full manual offers more control over what abilities are used, when they are used, and how they are used.


## Why You Should Switch to Full Manual


**^^A Comparison Between Revolution and Full Manual^^**



⬥ **^^Channeled abilities^^**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Usually last longer than a Global Cooldown (3 ticks or 1.8s).

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Have an extra delay between the last hit of the ability and the start of the next ability.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- This only really applies to Snipe, but you still want to manually cancel Concentrated Blast or Fury to be 2 hits instead of 3 hits, which revolution would do.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- This delay can be negated by manually inputting the next ability.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Revolution will let the delay run its course, which wastes time and damage.



⬥ Below is a comparison of manually canceling a channeled ability vs just letting revo do it for you. The player in the top version will let revo cancel Snipe for them, with no manual input at all. The player in the bottom version will manually cancel the Snipe ability to initiate the next ability quicker. Notice how long the top player just stands idle after Snipe.

*Note: Manually canceling channeled abilities can be done on Revolution mode. But, it still requires a manual input from the player with precise timing.*


⬥ **^^Ultimate abilities^^**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Should normally be used manually even if using Revolution (except afk slayer).

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Good Revolution bars will have the stronger abilities towards the beginning of the revo bar so they get activated more frequently.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- This is good for general usage but detrimental for damage boosting ultimates like Sunshine <img title="Sunshine" class="d-emoji" alt="Sunshine" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/583430011948630016.png?v=1">, Death's Swiftness <img title="ds" class="d-emoji" alt="ds" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535541258924326912.png?v=1"> and Berserk <img title="zerk" class="d-emoji" alt="zerk" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535532854004678657.png?v=1">.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• The best abilities will likely be on cooldown at the start of your damage boosting ult due to being at the front of the revo bar.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Some of the best abilities are bleeds which will be near the front of the revo bar, but bleeds are NOT boosted by damage boosting ultimates.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Full manual benefits a lot in damage boosting ultimates because you have full control of when you use the strong abilities.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Strong abilities can be saved until you are within the damage boosting ultimate to get more out of them.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Bleed usage can be easily avoided in damage boosting ultimates since you can just choose to not input any bleed abilities.



⬥ The gif below will demonstrate how Revolution can make someone use bad abilities in a damage boosting ultimate. Take a look at what abilities were used right after sunshine:

 ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Using Full Manual, this person would have been able to plan out what abilities are used prior to activating Sunshine <img title="Sunshine" class="d-emoji" alt="Sunshine" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/583430011948630016.png?v=1">.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- They can choose to use bleeds such as Corruption Blast <img title="corruptblast" class="d-emoji" alt="corruptblast" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/513190159194259467.png?v=1"> or Combust <img title="comb" class="d-emoji" alt="comb" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535533833098100745.png?v=1">, or they can choose to use a weaker ability such as Sonic Wave <img title="sonic" class="d-emoji" alt="sonic" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535533809924571136.png?v=1"> right before Sunshine <img title="Sunshine" class="d-emoji" alt="Sunshine" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/583430011948630016.png?v=1"> to make sure the good abilities like Dragon Breath <img title="dbreath" class="d-emoji" alt="dbreath" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535533833391702017.png?v=1"> and Impact <img title="impactflank" class="d-emoji" alt="impactflank" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/867678154369400862.png?v=1"> are off cooldown and ready to use in Sunshine <img title="Sunshine" class="d-emoji" alt="Sunshine" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/583430011948630016.png?v=1">.


**^^Boss Mechanics^^**

As you progress in PvM and face tougher and tougher bosses, you will encounter bosses with mechanics where revolution could greatly hinder your combat ability. Here are a few scenarios where revolution could cause more harm than good:



⬥ **Araxxor:**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• During his web shield, the player must manually input to stop attacking, otherwise all damage dealt gets reflected onto the player, potentially causing a KO



⬥ **Vorago:**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• During his reflect, damage gets reflected onto a player and Revo requires a manual input for the player to stop attacking



⬥ **Telos:**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• For "Hold Still, Invader", you switch to a shield and use Resonance <img title="res" class="d-emoji" alt="res" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535541258844635148.png?v=1">. This does require precise timing and if you are not on FM, there is a chance that Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance <img title="res" class="d-emoji" alt="res" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535541258844635148.png?v=1">, activating GCD which will ruin your timing.



⬥ **Kalphite King:**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• During his green attack, you're required to provoke KK, then use either Devotion or Resonance <img title="res" class="d-emoji" alt="res" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535541258844635148.png?v=1"> to negate damage/heal from the large hit.



⬥ **Nex:**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Any attacks during Blood Siphon will heal Nex rather than hurt her, requiring manual input to prevent Revolution from attacking her.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• During Blood Phase, Nex heals from bleeds, requiring manual input to avoid using bleeds.



⬥ **Helwyr:**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• For his swipe attack, a common strategy to deal with it is to Resonance <img title="res" class="d-emoji" alt="res" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535541258844635148.png?v=1"> it to heal some health back. This does require precise timing and if you are not on FM, there is a chance that Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance <img title="res" class="d-emoji" alt="res" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535541258844635148.png?v=1">, activating GCD which will ruin your timing.


⬥ ^^**Revo with mostly manual inputs**^^

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• There is not much difference between using Full Manual without Revolution, versus Full Manual with Revolution as a backup.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- The biggest difference between the two is without revo, you have insurance that you will never use an ability that you didn't mean to use.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Auto attacks do not work well with Revolution. For example with Magic if you wish to utilize 4TAA, you need to input the auto attack once to cancel your next revo input. and again to actually fire the auto attack.



⬥ **^^5 tick auto attack (5TAA)^^**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Melee and Ranged cannot utilize 5TAA because there is no "auto" button like Magic has with casting a spell to stop the next ability from happening.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• 5TAA can normally be used instead of a weaker ability if the better abilities happen to be on cooldown at the same time.


## How to Transition from Revolution to Full Manual


**^^Step by step^^**



⬥ **Set good keybinds.**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• It is very important to have keybinds that are comfortable to reach and make sense to you.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• It is up to the user to decide what keybinds make sense to them.



⬥ **Practice the keybinds.**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Spend time at combat dummies just getting used to the keybinds, and commit them to muscle memory. Your goal is to not need to think about what keybind does what ability. You should know what ability you want to do, and the muscle memory should do the rest for you.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Another good place to practice is God Wars Dungeon 2 due to how it has low death potential and can earn you some money as you practice the new keybinds.



⬥ **Gradual transition, or fully commit.**

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Some players find it easier to start easing into full manual by keeping revo active as a backup, but using more and more manual inputs until they feel confident enough to turn revo off.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎• Some players find it easer to rip the band aid off and just turn off revo, then practice their keybinds over and over until they are confident enough to use full manual in real PvM scenarios.

 ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎- Again, it is up to the user to decide what works best for them.
